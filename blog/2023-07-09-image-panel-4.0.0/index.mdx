## Image zooming in and out

The plugin supports image zooming in and out, which simplifies the display of images within the plugin's panel and allows you to reset the scale of high-resolution images to fit the available display area.

When enabling the image zooming on the panel toolbar, you can choose between the Full Screen or Pan and Pinch modes.

## Description

We added the capability to show captions for images and media files. Captions are displayed below the area rendering images or media files.

Images are scaled automatically when using the Height option in the plugin settings. When using the original height, you need to manually adjust the dimensions of the display area.
