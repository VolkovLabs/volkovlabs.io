## Downloads

The Business Charts panel seems unstoppable with the number of its downloads worldwide. It went from 2M to more than 3M in 5 months. Wow!

## Included Bar, Sunburst, and Radar into the Visual editor

We are actively working on expanding the Visual Editor functionality. In this release, we added more parameters for the Bar, Sunburst, and Radar types.
The best way to learn what is available now is to review the updated examples at https://echarts.volkovlabs.io

Open a chart in the Edit mode and review the type-specific available parameters.

More to come in the near future.

You can find this button at the top left corner of the Code parameter.

## Updated context migration from older versions

In the previous release of the Business Charts, we published a mandatory migration guide for the [`context` parameters](/blog/echarts-panel-6.0.0-20240406/#migration-guide).

Since then, several users have contacted us, mentioning their struggle with the migration process. In this release, we updated automatic migration (where possible) to mitigate the migration effort.

Based of the feedback, that change lifted the migration burden significantly. However, please be aware that you might still have problems with some marginal cases.
