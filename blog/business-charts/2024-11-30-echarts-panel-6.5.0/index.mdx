# Improved Code Editor, included scatter and boxplot into Visual Editor, and Grafana 11.3 Scenes updates in Business Charts 6.5.0

We are happy to announce the release of the Business Charts panel 6.5.0. This release includes the following updates:

- Improved Autosize Code Editor.
- Included Scatter and Boxplot into the Visual Editor.
- Added Promise libraries import.
- Compatibility with Grafana 11.3 and Scenes-powered dashboards.

## Downloads

The Business Charts panel is another plugin from our [Business Suite plugin collection](/plugins/) reaching the dazzling milestone of 4,000,000 downloads.

## Improved Autosize Code Editor

The Autosize Code Editor opens in a new window after a user clicks on the four-direction button.

  width="20%"
/>

You can find this button at the top left corner of the **Code** parameter.

/>

To improve the user experience further, we added the following four buttons:

- **Copy code**. Copies the highlighted code in the memory buffer.
- **Paste code**. Pastes the content of the memory buffer.
- **Wrap code on new lines**. Fits the text into the visible area on the screen.
- **Show/Hide mini map**. Shows/hides the far right area depicting the code at scale.

## Included scatter and boxplot into the Visual Editor

We added the Visual Editor to simplify working with the Grafana data frames and facilitate intuitive data transmission into the [Charts function](/plugins/business-charts/options/).

The Visual Editor should significantly help to work with datasets, but it does not eliminate the need for the [Charts function](/plugins/business-charts/options/).

This feature is in the beta version. As of now, it should work for all charts enabled in the **Type** dropdown.

<Image
  title="The Type dropdown location."
  src="/img/blog/2024-11-30-echarts-panel-6.5.0/type-location.png"
/>

_In development_ means that this type is coming soon. All other types are available for selection.

### Boxplot

The boxplot is a chart depicting a variable distribution in a compact way where you can compare it over time or between multiple entities.

<Image
  title="Using the Visual Editor to build a Boxplot chart type.."
  src="/img/blog/2024-11-30-echarts-panel-6.5.0/boxplot-basic.png"
/>

1. Required dataframe. For each distribution, you provide the minimum, the first quartile (25% mark), the median, the third quartile (75% mark), and maximum values.

| Category | min | q1  | median | q3  | maximum |
| -------- | --- | --- | ------ | --- | ------- |
| a        | 1   | 2   | 3      | 4   | 5       |
| b        | 2   | 3   | 4      | 5   | 6       |
| c        | 3   | 4   | 5      | 6   | 7       |
| d        | 4   | 5   | 6      | 7   | 8       |

2. Datasets. For the **Boxplot**, you need to add six datasets, where the first dataset should contain the category, then minimum values, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum. The order of the datasets is important.

3. Chart Type. Set it to the **Boxplot**.

4. Chart Type specific options. There are no specific options to specify with the latest plugin release.

5. Charts Function.

```javascript
return {
  tooltip: {},
  dataset: context.editor.dataset,
  series: context.editor.series,
  xAxis: {
    type: "category",
  },
  yAxis: {
    type: "value",
  },
};
```

### Scatter

The scatter (also known as scatter graph, scatter plot, scatergram) is a chart that uses Cartesian coordinates to depict a value for two variables.

<Image
  title="Using the Visual Editor to build a Scatter chart type."
  src="/img/blog/2024-11-30-echarts-panel-6.5.0/scatter-basic.png"
/>

1. Required dataframe. One data frame should consist of three columns, X and Y coordinates and then a value to display. For instance:

| Yaxis | Xaxis | Size |
| ----- | ----- | ---- |
| 10    | 8.04  | 20   |
| 8.07  | 6.95  | 21   |
| 13.0  | 7.58  | 22   |
| 9.05  | 8.81  | 23   |
| 11    | 8.33  | 24   |

2. Datasets. For the **Scatter**, you need to add three datasets.

3. Chart Type. Set it to the **Scatter**.

4. Chart Type specific options. Specify which dataset should play the role of X coordinates, Y coordinates, and the value associated with each (x,y) coordinate.

5. Charts Function.

```javascript
return {
  dataset: context.editor.dataset,
  series: context.editor.series,
  grid: {
    bottom: "3%",
    containLabel: true,
    left: "3%",
    right: "4%",
    top: "4%",
  },
  /**
   * Should be added to see tooltip
   */
  tooltip: {},
  xAxis: {
    type: "value",
  },
  yAxis: {
    type: "value",
  },
};
```

## Added Promise libraries import

We started decoupling plugin's core from the embedded libraries to make the Business Charts panel more flexible and lightweight. As of this release, all libraries are still part of the Business Charts panel. However, we are getting ready for a complete split in v7.0.0.

Starting from this release, it is optional and will become mandatory in the upcoming releases to import an external library using the [Promises technology](https://www.promisejs.org).

The syntax is identical to the [Business Text import functionality](/plugins/business-text/external/).

```javascript
/**
 * echarts-stat import
 */
import("https://esm.sh/echarts-stat@1.2.0").then(({ default: ecStatImport }) => {
  context.echarts.registerTransform(ecStatImport.transform.regression);
```

You can review the above example in our [sandbox project](https://echarts.volkovlabs.io/d/bdxgf42bbwphce/imports).

The detailed steps are outlined below:

1. Go to the [echarts.volkovlabs.io](https://echarts.volkovlabs.io)
2. Open **Dashboards** -> **Imports**.
3. Open any panel in the **Edit** mode, for instance, the [linear regression chart](https://echarts.volkovlabs.io/d/bdxgf42bbwphce/imports?from=now-6h&to=now&editPanel=10).
4. Scroll down in the **Code**->**Function** parameter almost to the end.

## Compatibility with Grafana 11.3 and Scenes-powered dashboards

The [Scenes powered dashboards in Grafana 11.3 release](https://grafana.com/blog/2024/10/31/grafana-dashboards-are-now-powered-by-scenes-big-changes-same-ui/) introduced some breaking changes for our plugins.

Starting from release 6.5.0, the Business Charts panel fully migrated to support Grafana 11.3.
