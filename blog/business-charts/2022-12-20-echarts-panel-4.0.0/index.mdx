# Business Charts 4.0.0

We are happy to announce the release of the Business Charts panel 4.0.0. This release includes the following updates:

- Introduced breaking changes with loading GeoJSON maps, which are disabled by default.
- Documentation and examples were updated and moved to our [documentation](/plugins/business-charts/) and [Plugin Examples](https://echarts.volkovlabs.io).

We are very excited about the new release and will continue improving the plugin by adding support for annotations and custom themes.
