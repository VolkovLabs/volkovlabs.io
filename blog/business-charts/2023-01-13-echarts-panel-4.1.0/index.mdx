# Streaming, data zoom, and documentation updates in Business Charts 4.1.0

We are happy to announce the release of the Business Charts panel 4.1.0 for Grafana. This release includes the following updates:

- Added support for streaming for WebSockets and Grafana Live.
- Added the Data Zoom feature updating a time range similar to the TimeSeries panel.
- Updated the product documentation answering community questions.

## Streaming

Streaming enables real-time data updates using streaming data sources and Grafana Live. You can find examples and configurations in [our documentation](/plugins/business-charts/streaming).

### Grafana Live

Grafana Live is a real-time messaging engine introduced in Grafana v8.0. With Grafana Live, you can push event data to a frontend as soon as an event occurs.

### WebSocket API

To stream real-time data, we used the [WebSocket data source for Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/golioth-websocket-datasource/).

## Data Zoom feature

The Data Zoom feature allows you to select a time period on the chart for zooming in. Once the time range is selected, the event can update the time range on the dashboard using the `locationService` parameter, similar to native Grafana behavior.
