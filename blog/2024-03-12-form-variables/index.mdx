# Synchronize dashboard variables with Data Manipulation panel

This blog post was initiated by our GitHub sponsor and community questions. While working on a detailed answer, we realized that the solution to this question covers multiple hot Grafana topics and might thus be of interest to many Community members.

Collaboration with the Community, if used wisely, can produce great results. Many times it inspired us to take an unexpected but very anticipated turn on the product roadmap. Collecting ideas and struggles worldwide is a clever way to move forward by creating the most coveted products.

We are aware that our readers come from a wide range of backgrounds. To better convey today's topic, we constructed a tiny project for which we describe two statesâ€”current and enhanced. Following this article, you can learn how to go from one to another, or in other words, you can start with a current-state dashboard and then enhance it with all the required features.

We are open to questions; please leave them as comments on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@volkovlabs).

## Current state

We will start by describing the project in its current state.

- A Grafana dashboard with three hierarchical dashboard variables.
- Any panel that rerenders according to the selected dashboard variable combination.

## Dashboard variables

The dashboard variables have a hierarchical structure. From the Grafana perspective, this means that the second variable is limited by the first and the third is limited by the second.

<Image

  src="/img/blog/2024-03-12-form-variables/data-format.png"
/>

Here is what the configuration of the dashboard variables looks like. We usually use the [Business Input Data Source](/plugins/volkovlabs-static-datasource) in our demo projects. We do it for many reasons, including making it straightforward to follow our steps.

For reference below are the dashboard variables described in the JSON format:

```

## Enhanced state

The requirements for the enhanced state are as follows:

- Add the Data Manipulation panel that mirrors the functionality of the dashboard variables.
- Allows to enter observations and comments related to the selected variables.

The described solution consists of these components:

- Synchronization between dashboard variables and the Data Manipulation form elements.
- Using a new Data Manipulation feature **Element Value Changed**. It is a JavaScript code area that is executed in the event of any form element changing a value.
- Conditional enablement of the **Submit** button.

<Image
  title="The final dashboard with variables, data manipulation and other panels."
  src="/img/blog/2024-03-12-form-variables/final-product.png"
/>

## Step 1. Add the Data Manipulation panel

Add the Data Manipulation panel and create three form elements with the type **Select with Custom Options**: facility, room, and bench.

<Image
  title="Three 'Select with Custom Options' form elements on the dashboard."
  src="/img/blog/2024-03-12-form-variables/form-elements.png"
/>

## Step 2. Configure the Data Manipulation

The selectable options for each **Select with Custom Options** form element should be populated dynamically and be identical to the current dashboard variables choices.

Thus, we use the same approach, namely the [Business Input Data Source](/plugins/volkovlabs-static-datasource). As shown below, we create three queries: Facility Options, Room Options, Bench Options.

All queries return two columns: `value[string]` and `label[string]`. The values for the Facility Options are hard-coded. For the Room Options and Bench options, the values are taken from the currently selected `facility` and `room` dashboard variables respectively.

<Image
  title="Specify option lists for the three form elements."
  src="/img/blog/2024-03-12-form-variables/options-query.png"
/>

### Mapping

After a data frame is configured, we can map its fields with the form elements.

In the current Data Manipulation panel release, every **Select with Custom Options** type has three choices for the **Options source**: **Query**, **Custom**, and **Code**.

When **Query** is selected, you can specify which fields from the available data frames contain **Value Field** and **Label Field**.

<Image
  title="Set 'Option Source' to 'Query' and specify Value and Label Fields for each form element."
  src="/img/blog/2024-03-12-form-variables/query-options-source.png"
/>

At this point, your Data Manipulation form should have three form elements with hierarchical dependencies.
That means that the listing of Room Names is limited by the selected Facility Name and the listing of Bench Names is limited by the selected Room Name.

<Image
  title="Three form elements with hierarchical dependencies.."
  src="/img/blog/2024-03-12-form-variables/query-options-example.png"
/>

:::info

In this example two sets of filters, in the dashboard variables and the Data Manipulation panel, are identical. This comes as an initial requirement. Note, that technically those two lists might differ. However, we are not aware of a good use case for not alike lists.

:::

## Step 3. Sync the initial values

If you open the dashboard now, the Data Manipulation will display "Choose" in all **Select with Custom Options** element types. At this step, we sync the Data Manipulation form elements with the dashboard variables for the initial load event.

<Image
  title="At this step, the form elements are not synced with the dashboard variables on Initial load."
  src="/img/blog/2024-03-12-form-variables/no-values-oninit.png"
/>

To facilitate the Initial load synchronization between dashboard variables and the Data Manipulation form elements we add the query and select the corresponding Initial Action.

### Query

Add a new query to the Data Manipulation Form returning the necessary values. We name it 'Initial Values'. In the values specify a reference to the corresponding dashboard variables.

<Image
  title="Initial Values query for the panel."
  src="/img/blog/2024-03-12-form-variables/initial-values.png"
/>

### Initial Action

Update the Data Manipulation panel options to enable the **Query** option for **Initial Action**.

<Image
  title="Enabled 'Query' for the 'Initial Action'."
  src="/img/blog/2024-03-12-form-variables/query-initial-action.png"
/>

For every form element specify the field where an initial value should come from. When the **Query** selected in the **Initial Action**, a new parameter **Query Field** appears. Populate it with the appropriate field name.

<Image
  title="'Query Field' parameter appears when you select 'Query for 'Initial Action' parameter as mentioned above."
  src="/img/blog/2024-03-12-form-variables/element-query-field.png"
/>

## Step 4. Ensure the values synchronize in real time

In this step, we ensure that the changes are reflected in the dashboard variable whenever a user changes anything on the Data Manipulation form.
That can be done in the newest Data Manipulation option **Element Value Changed**, section **Form Events**.

:::note

The opposite synchronization is already in place since the values for the current Data Manipulation form elements are taken from the dashboard variables using data source.

:::

<Image
  title="JavaScript code specified in the 'Element Value Changed' option runs after any value change."
  src="/img/blog/2024-03-12-form-variables/form-events.png"
/>

The JavaScript code to ensure the dashboard variables follow the Data Manipulation form elements selected values:

```js
if (context.element.id === "facility") {
  context.grafana.locationService.partial({
    "var-facility": context.element.value,
  });
}

if (context.element.id === "room") {
  context.grafana.locationService.partial({
    "var-room": context.element.value,
  });
}

if (context.element.id === "bench") {
  context.grafana.locationService.partial({
    "var-bench": context.element.value,
  });
}
```

## Step 5. Enable submit button

The most appealing scenario is when the **Submit** button is initiated in the disabled status and is enabled only under certain conditions, for instance, form element value change.

<Image
  title="The 'Submit' button is enabled following the form element values change."
  src="/img/blog/2024-03-12-form-variables/submit.png"
/>

That can be achieved by changing **Enable Update** option to **Manual**.

<Image
  title="Set 'Enable Update' option to 'Manual'."
  src="/img/blog/2024-03-12-form-variables/enable-update-manual.png"
/>

### JavaScript Code

Modify the JavaScript code in the **Element Value Changed** by adding one row at the end.

<Image
  title="Modify the JavaScript code to enable the 'Submit' button."
  src="/img/blog/2024-03-12-form-variables/form-events-submit.png"
/>

JavaScript code to enable the **Submit** button manually.

```js
context.panel.enableSubmit();
```

## Congratulations
