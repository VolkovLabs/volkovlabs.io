We appreciate the feedback and interest in the Variable panel plugin. Provided functionality was requested by the community many times and we gladly contributed.

## Demo

Interested to try the panel? Take a look at [Grafana plugins registered in the Grafana Catalog](https://release.volkovlabs.io/d/O73WAt27z/plugin-info?orgId=1&var-slug=volkovlabs-variable-panel).

One of my favorite features in this release is the sticky header, which allows you to filter values and select favorites. Statuses indicate when the plugin was updated:

- Green less than 365 days.
- Yellow for more than 365 days.
- Red for more than 730 days.

## Single value table

The single value table was updated to support the `All` option and allows to select a single value by clicking on it.

## Collapse and expand all

We added a new collapse and expand all button next to the variable title in the header. It's a must-have feature to expand and collapse all branches at the same time for 5+ levels.

## Tree View groups

A new feature allows to drag and drop configured Tree View groups to rearrange how they will be displayed on the panel.

## YouTube Tutorial

The Variable panel builds on top of the regular dashboard variables. It allows you to have dashboard filters in a separate panel which you can place anywhere on the dashboard.

The variable panel offers you single- and multi-variable layouts along with an advanced Tree View.
