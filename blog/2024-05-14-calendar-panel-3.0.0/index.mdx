## Business Calendar Panel

The Calendar panel joins the [Business Suite](/plugins/) for Grafana and with that gets an elevated name. Now, the same amazing open source plugin is called the Business Calendar panel.

Please welcome the new name for the same functionality!

## Big Calendar

We employed the [Big Calendar library](https://jquense.github.io/react-big-calendar/examples/index.html?path=/story/about-big-calendar--page) in September of 2023. It is an open source powerful React library allowing many features such as:

- Switch between month, week, and day views.
- Switch back to the current day (today).
- Display events from the previous and subsequent time ranges.
- Professional style.
- Many others.

The users preferred this library over the Legacy so often that we do not see the need to support the Legacy library anymore.
Starting from this release there will be only Big Calendar mode and the Legacy option disappears from the user choice.

## Extended date formats

As you know, there is a Language setting in the user profile preference. Along with language this setting also impacts the displayed date formats.
The currently existing choices were not enough for some of our use cases. We added **English 24** and **ISO 8601** formats.

## Grafana 10 and Grafana 11

:::warning Breaking changes
Grafana 9 is not supported.
:::

Our plugins always follow the latest Grafana versions and stay compatible with the most recent releases. That means, however, that we have to sunset the support of obsolete releases.

The latest Business Calendar Panel 3.0.0 fully supports Grafana 10 and the upcoming 11 releases.
