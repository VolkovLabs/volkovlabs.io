## Big Calendar

We employed the [Big Calendar library](https://jquense.github.io/react-big-calendar/examples/index.html?path=/story/about-big-calendar--page) in September of 2023. It is an open-source powerful React library allowing many features such as:

- Switch between month, week, and day views.
- Switch back to the current day (today).
- Display events from the previous and subsequent time ranges.
- Professional style.
- Many others.

The users preferred this library over the Legacy so often that we do not see the need to support the Legacy library anymore.
Starting from this release there will be only Big Calendar mode and the Legacy option disappears from the user choice.

## Extended date formats

As you know, there is a Language setting in the user profile preference. Along with language this setting also impacts the displayed date formats.
The currently existing choices were not enough for some of our use cases. We added **English 24** and **ISO 8601** formats.
