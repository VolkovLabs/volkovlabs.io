# Annotations, Alerts and Annotation Queries in Grafana

The time series graph in Grafana is a one-dimensional data, which displays collected values from the device. In real-world situations based on that data personnel can add native annotations, and alerts can be triggered when values go above and beyond thresholds.

Personnel can also do Control which can affect collected values and we would like to see all of them on the same chart.

Another mystery we want to solve is when an alert is configured for a particular dashboard and panel with a variable. It will display broken heart emoji for the panel which does not depend on the variable.

## Annotations

Annotations might seem different from the Alerts, but under the hood, they are very similar.

## Introduction

This is an introductory video for anyone interested in Grafana Alerts and Annotations.

### Native Annotations

Native annotations are added manually by Editors and Administrators and reflect various situations.

### Alerts

Alerts are created automatically when alerting rules are triggered.

## Dashboard Variables

Watch this video to learn more about the dashboard, global, and environment variables in Grafana.

If the Alerting rule has Dashboard and Panel Ids set, then the Time Series panel will display broken heart emoji. It's understandable behavior for particular graphs which don't depend on the Dashboard variables.

For example, if you have a dashboard that displays device information using Dashboard variables, then when one of the devices triggers an alert you don't necessarily want to see alerting notification for all devices. Same for the Native Annotations.

## Grafana HTTP API Data Source

To display Annotations and other information from local and remote Grafana instances we introduced Grafana HTTP API Data Source. It uses API Keys or tokens to request information and visualize in panels or use in annotations.

## Summary

Visualizing annotations, alerts, annotation queries and time series on a graph allows one to see the big picture and react to the changes quickly.
