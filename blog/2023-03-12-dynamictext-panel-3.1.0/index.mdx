## Time Range and Zone

Added the Time Zone and Time Range parameters enabling the display of the selected time zone and time ranges with custom handlers.

Here is an example of how to display the selected dashboard, user's time zone, and time range in Grafana.

### Content

````
<h2>Dashboard {{tz}}</h1>
<h2>Browser {{browser}}</h1>

```json
{{{json (range)}}}
```
````

### JavaScript Code

```
handlebars.registerHelper('tz', () => timeZone);
handlebars.registerHelper('range', () => timeRange);
handlebars.registerHelper('browser', () => Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone);
```

## Replace Variables

Updated the `replaceVariable` function with a scoped function and added support for repeated panels.

Dynamic Text Panel provides the `{{variable}}` helper to work with dashboard and global variables. Alternatively, you can create a custom Handlebars helper to introduce additional logic and formats.

### Content

```md
- Native helper **{{variable "test"}}**
- Custom helper **{{myVariable "test"}}**
```

### JavaScript Code

```js
handlebars.registerHelper("myVariable", (name) => replaceVariables(`$${name}`));
```

## Magic (JavaScript) Trio

One of the three plugins that complete Grafana is Dynamic Text Panel. With Dynamic Text, Data Manipulation, and Business Charts Panel you can create fully functional web applications meeting your needs and expectations.

## YouTube Tutorial

Dynamic Text Panel is a Grafana visualization plugin that converts plain text and table data into visually appealing, easy-to-read information cards. You can use variables, Markdown, and Handlebars to customize the look of the outputted cards.

The Dynamic Text Panel plugin allows you to construct a text visualization template from the values of a dataset returned by a data source query.
