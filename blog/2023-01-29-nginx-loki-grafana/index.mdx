# Website Analytics based on Nginx, Loki, Promtail, and Grafana

In this weekend's project, we are interested in the content metrics for our website. Who, What, and from Where requested resources from blog and documentation. To achieve this goal, we configured Nginx, Loki, Promtail to work together and show all required metrics on a Grafana dashboard.

You may google around and find various dashboards, outdated GitHub repositories, and other pieces of information covering some steps. I could not find a straightforward and up-to-date resource describing what I wanted to accomplish.

## Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics to track activities on our website. Every time when I open it, I want to close it. Why? The interface is too cluttered with campaigns, revenue, retention, and channels.

You can spend extra time configuring custom dashboards and reports, but I still feel we are missing user activities. One of the reason, reporting requests are blocked on firewalls, security, and VPN devices. Collecting user activities directly from the web server will help to avoid losing data.

## Log flow

Let's examine each component's functions and take a closer look at each of them one-by-one.

- Nginx serves website and produce log files.
- Loki aggregates log files.
- Promtail collects, processes log file from Nginx and pushes to Loki.
- Grafana displays content and technical metrics from Loki using Loki data source.

## Nginx

Nginx is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and cache. We use it in front of all our projects and it's installed on the host for optimal performance.

When you configure format of the log files produced by Nginx, you can collect everything and then decided what do you need or may need in future. Other option is to choose what you really need and keep it short. For this project we selected:

| Variable             | Description                                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `time_local`         | Local time.                                              |
| `remote_addr`        | Client IP.                                               |
| `request_uri`        | Full path and arguments for the request.                 |
| `status`             | Response status code.                                    |
| `http_referer`       | HTTP referer.                                            |
| `http_user_agent`    | HTTP clients - user agents.                              |
| `server_name`        | The name of the server handling the request.             |
| `request_time`       | Request processing time in seconds with msec resolution. |
| `geoip_country_code` | Geo location based on client IP.                         |

We also added additional configuration to the main configuration file `nginx.conf` to get as clean input data as possible and avoid further processing in Promtail and Grafana.

```nginx title=nginx.conf
http {
  map $http_referer $httpReferer {
    default "$http_referer";
    ""      "(direct)";
  }

  map $http_user_agent $httpAgent {
    default "$http_user_agent";
    ""      "Unknown";
  }

  map $geoip_country_code $geoIP {
    default "$geoip_country_code";
    ""      "Unknown";
  }

  geoip_country /usr/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat;

  log_format json_analytics escape=json '{'
    '"time_local": "$time_local", '
    '"remote_addr": "$remote_addr", '
    '"request_uri": "$request_uri", '
    '"status": "$status", '
    '"http_referer": "$httpReferer", '
    '"http_user_agent": "$httpAgent", '
    '"server_name": "$server_name", '
    '"request_time": "$request_time", '
    '"geoip_country_code": "$geoIP"'
    '}';
}
```

- Replace empty values in `http_referer` with `(direct)` similar to Google Analytics.
- Replace empty values in `http_user_agent` with `Unknown`.
- Replace empty values in `geoip_country_code` with `Unknown`.
- Use preinstalled Geo IP database `/usr/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat`.
- Add `json_analytics` logging JSON format with provided variables, which we will use for server blocks.

A produced JSON record from the log file looks like this.

```json title=analytics.log
{
  "time_local": "29/Jan/2023:02:57:08 +0000",
  "remote_addr": "111.222.334.444",
  "request_uri": "/plugins/volkovlabs-form-panel/request/",
  "status": "200",
  "http_referer": "(direct)",
  "http_user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0",
  "server_name": "volkovlabs.io",
  "request_time": "0.000",
  "geoip_country_code": "CZ"
}
```

### Geo IP database

A Geo IP database is a database of IP addresses with their locations tagged, which we use in Nginx to perform geolocation using an IP address.

Preinstalled Geo IP database on our Linux server is out-dated, but works great for this project and does not required additional configuration. To be able to do geolocation, Nginx should have module [`ngx_http_geoip_module`](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_geoip_module.html) enabled.

```sh
/usr/share/GeoIP# ls -lrt
total 7912
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 6426573 Nov  8  2018 GeoIPv6.dat
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1672893 Nov  8  2018 GeoIP.dat
```

Modern [GeoIP2 database](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-databases) can be used instead of outdated Geo IP. It requires:

- Setup an account.
- Additional configuration for daily updates.
- Compile Nginx with additional module supporting GeoIP2.

You can easily find instructions on how to do it and go this route if required.

### Server configuration

Server blocks in Nginx can be used to encapsulate configuration details and host more than one domain on a single server. In the configuration file for the website we added additional logging in the file `analytics.log` using discussed JSON format.

```nginx
server {
  access_log /var/log/nginx/analytics.log json_analytics;
}
```

## Loki

Loki is a horizontally scalable, highly available, multi-tenant log aggregation system inspired by Prometheus. It does not index the contents of the logs, but rather a set of labels for each log stream.

In our environment we are running Loki in Docker container orchestrated using `docker-compose`.

```docker title=docker-compose.yml
  loki:
    container_name: loki
    image: grafana/loki:2.7.1
    network_mode: host
    volumes:
      - ./loki/data:/loki
      - ./loki/loki.yml:/etc/loki/local-config.yaml
```

- The data folder `/loki` stored in the volume folder on a local drive.
- Configuration file `/etc/loki/local-config.yaml` stored in the `loki` folder next to the data.
- Uses the latest stable version `2.7.1`.

Loki, Promtail, and Grafana containers are distributed on separate hosts, and we run them in the network host mode.

### Configuration

The configuration file is based on the default file shipped with `2.7.1` release. We updated configuration to increase the number of maximum outstanding requests to accommodate the Grafana dashboard.

```yaml title=./loki/loki.yml
auth_enabled: false

server:
  http_listen_port: 3100

common:
  path_prefix: /loki
  storage:
    filesystem:
      chunks_directory: /loki/chunks
      rules_directory: /loki/rules
  replication_factor: 1
  ring:
    kvstore:
      store: inmemory

schema_config:
  configs:
    - from: 2020-10-24
      store: boltdb-shipper
      object_store: filesystem
      schema: v11
      index:
        prefix: index_
        period: 24h

ruler:
  alertmanager_url: http://localhost:9093

query_scheduler:
  max_outstanding_requests_per_tenant: 10000
```

You can learn more about Loki configuration in the [Documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/configuration/).

## Promtail

Promtail is an agent which ships the contents of local logs to a private Grafana Loki instance. It is usually deployed to every machine that has applications needed to be monitored.

Similar to Loki we are running Promtail in Docker container orchestrated with `docker-compose`.

```docker title=docker-compose.yml
  promtail:
    image: grafana/promtail:2.7.1
    container_name: promtail
    network_mode: host
    volumes:
      - ./loki/promtail.yml:/etc/promtail/config.yml
      - /var/log/nginx:/var/log/nginx
```

- Configuration file `/etc/promtail/config.yml` stored in the `loki` folder.
- The Nginx log folder `/var/log/nginx` added to the container.
- Uses the latest stable version `2.7.1`.

### Configuration

Configuration file is based on the default file shipped with `2.7.1` release. We updated configuration for Nginx analytics log files to add labels `job`, `host`, `agent` and watch for `analytics.log` files.

Promtail push logs to the Loki specified in the configuration file `http://LOKI-IP:3100/loki/api/v1/push`, which is located on a separate host in our configuration.

```yaml title=./loki/promtail.yml
server:
  http_listen_port: 9080
  grpc_listen_port: 0

positions:
  filename: /tmp/positions.yaml

clients:
  - url: http://LOKI-IP:3100/loki/api/v1/push

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: nginx
    static_configs:
      - targets:
          - localhost
        labels:
          job: nginx
          host: volkovlabs.io
          agent: promtail
          __path__: /var/log/nginx/analytics*log
    pipeline_stages:
      - json:
          expressions:
            http_user_agent:
            request_uri:
      - drop:
          source: http_user_agent
          expression: "(bot|Bot|RSS|Inspect|test)"
      - drop:
          source: request_uri
          expression: "/(assets|img)/"
      - drop:
          source: request_uri
          expression: "/(robots.txt|favicon.ico)"
      - drop:
          source: request_uri
          expression: "(.php|.xml)$"
```

We added Pipeline stages to drop records we are not interested in.

- Requests from Googlebot, inspectors, test, network devices and RSS collectors.
- Requests for images and assets (Javascript, CSS) in the special folders.
- Requests for particular files for browsers and indexing engines.
- Malicious request from scanners to find PHP and XML files.

The [Pipelines](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/pipelines/) can be changed and updated based on your requirements.

## Grafana

We love Grafana and use it for all our projects. We covered installation process in the video.

### Loki data source

A Loki data source is preinstalled in Grafana. We used URL `http://localhost:3100` to connect to the private Loki instance without authorization.

## Analytics Dashboard

Website Analytics dashboard was inspired by [Grafana Loki Dashboard for NGINX Service Mesh](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/12559-grafana-loki-dashboard-for-nginx-service-mesh/?pg=dashboards&plcmt=featured-main), one of the most interesting and updated dashboard we can find for Nginx.

Each panel and query was updated according to our styling guidelines and requirements.

<Image
  title="Table panel with values mapping for 50+ countries to display Geo locations."
  src="/img/blog/2023-01-29-nginx-loki-grafana/table.png"
/>

### Content metrics

The first part of the dashboard provides content metrics - Who, What, and from Where requested resources.

<Image
  title="Processing."
  src="/img/blog/2023-01-29-nginx-loki-grafana/content.png"
/>

- Geomap displays number of request for each Geo location, except unrecognized countries replaced with `Unknown`.
- Requests panel displays total number of requests in the selected Time Range.
- Visitors per Hours displays number of unique remote IP addresses per hour.
- A list of countries as sorted table with values mapping. List of countries can be updated if required.
- Referers displays the location from where requested resources are being used.
- Successfully Requested Pages displays the most frequently requested resources.

### Technical metrics

The second part of the dashboard contains technical information.

<Image
  title="Processing."
  src="/img/blog/2023-01-29-nginx-loki-grafana/technical.png"
/>

- Processing Time (95th Percentile and Max latency) to diagnose for any technical issues with delivering content.
- Status of the HTTP requests in 5 minutes blocks displayed as bars.
- The most frequently used User Agents with information about browser and platform.
- Logs to display raw logging information and verify that we are collecting only required fields and records.

### Import

To import the created dashboard, find the `Import` menu. The location might differ depending on your installed Grafana version, but that menu should always be somewhere.

<Image
  title="Import dashboard file into Grafana."
  src="/img/blog/2023-01-29-nginx-loki-grafana/import-menu.png"
/>

For the dashboard to function correctly, you must have the Loki data source installed and configured.

## Summary

The proposed solution beat our expectations, and we are looking forward to updating the Grafana dashboard based on the collected data in the upcoming weeks.

Eliminating unnecessary data allows to laser focus on the metrics we are looking for. The created dashboard is clean without unnecessary clutter — an excellent example of pure elegance.

Stay tuned for the video tutorial how to create and configure the Grafana dashboard in details on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@volkovlabs).
