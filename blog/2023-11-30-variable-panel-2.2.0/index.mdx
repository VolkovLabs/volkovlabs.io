## Dashboard redirect option

This feature allows opening the corresponding dashboard to a variable value. It is useful, for instance, if a variable panel displays a list of some devices where every device requires a specific dashboard. 

When a user selects a device in the variable panel, the corresponding dashboard opens. With that, the dashboard switch is not obvious for the users. For them, it might seem they stay in one place. 

Let us review, how to make it work.

### Map device_id to dashboard_id 

Create two dashboard variables. One to retrieve all devices needed. The second is to contain one dashboard_id at a time following the device from the first variable.

### Dashboards 

Create specific device dashboards with an identical variable panel on each dashboard.

### Variable panel

Configure the variable panel. Specify a value for the new parameter **Dashboard**.

/>

After the above-presented configuration, the variable panel switches dashboards when a user selects a device. A sleek transition makes the user experience smooth and pleasant.

## Search usability

Two features make the search user experience better. 

### Clean filter value button

It is a small, but very nice improvement. Once you start typing in the search text field, you can remove all entered symbols by using an X button appearing at the far-right corner of the search text.

/>

### Always Visible Search option

The ability to hide a search text area can be taken away from users by using a new option **Always Visible search**. 

When it is **Disabled**, the funnel icon is shown on the dashboard. By clicking on the funnel icon, users can alternate between hiding and showing the search text area. 

When it is **Enabled**, the funnel icon is hidden and with that users are not capable of hiding the search text area.

## Tree View improvements

### Group rename

Now you can rename a group in the TreeView layout.

### Expand by clicking anywhere

Before this feature, in order to expand the tree node, you had to be very precise and aim exactly at the arrow next to the name. After this release, clicking anywhere on the whole row with the name expands the tree node.

## Updated Safari layout

In the Safari web browser, the positioning of star icons indicating the favorites is now aligned in the same style as in all other browsers.

## Getting Started

The Variable panel can be installed from the [Grafana Catalog](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/volkovlabs-variable-panel/) or utilizing the Grafana command line tool.

For the latter, please use the following command.

```bash
grafana-cli plugins install volkovlabs-variable-panel
```

## YouTube Tutorial

The Variable panel builds on top of the regular dashboard variables. It allows you to have dashboard filters in a separate panel which you can place anywhere on the dashboard.

The variable panel offers you single- and multi-variable layouts along with an advanced Tree View.
