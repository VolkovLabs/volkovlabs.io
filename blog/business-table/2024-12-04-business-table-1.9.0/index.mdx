## Ability to add and delete a row

This is the most requested feature. Starting from this release, an end user of your Business Table panel can add and remove rows from Grafana dashboard!

<Image

  src="/img/blog/2024-12-04-business-table-1.9.0/table-add-delete-row.gif"
  width="70%"
/>

Below are details on how you can configure this new feature.

Use **Add data** parameter category to configure:

1.  Which tabs of your Business Table panel should allow to add a row.
2.  What columns should a user specify while adding a new row. It is done by turning on the switch next to a column name.
3.  The **Editor Type** is a UI element to enter a new value.
4.  [Permission](/plugins/business-table/permission/) is a granular control of who is allowed to add a new row. It is configured per each tab individually.
5.  **Add Request** consists of a data source and the query.

Use **Delete data** parameter category to configure:

6.  Which tabs of your Business Table panel should allow to delete a row.
7.  [Permission](/plugins/business-table/permission/) is a granular control of who is allowed to delete a row. It is configured per each tab individually.
8.  **Delete Request** consists of a data source and the query.

## Option to hide the table header

You can hide the Business Table header from the dashboard by turning off the **Layout**->**Show header** switch.

<Image
  title="Show or hide the table header."
  src="/img/blog/2024-12-04-business-table-1.9.0/show-hide.png"
  width="70%"
/>

## Support variables in the data sources for all data flow configurations

All Business Table data flows are configurable separately, allowing unbeatable flexibility. Starting from this release, a data source in every flow can be specified as a variable.

Let's say a Grafana dashboard has the following dashboard variable:

- **Variable type**: Data source,
- **Name**: DS,
- **Type**: PostgreSQL.

<Image
  title="Dashboard variable example."
  src="/img/blog/2024-12-04-business-table-1.9.0/dashboard-variable-ds.png"
  width="60%"
/>

You can use this variable in every data flow that affects:

- row,
- [nested objects](/plugins/business-table/nested/) stored as a column value.

### Row

Rows has three possible data flows:

- **Add data**. Executed:
  - if the [add a row functionality](#ability-to-add-and-delete-a-row) is allowed,
  - after a user clicks on a (+) icon to add a new row.
- **Editable data**. Executed:
  - if the [edit a row](/blog/business-table-1.3.0/#edit-data-and-impose-permission-protection) functionality is allowed,
  - after a user clicks on the pencil icon to edit a row.
- **Delete data**. Executed:
  - if the [delete a row functionality](#ability-to-add-and-delete-a-row) is allowed,
  - after a user clicks on a trash can icon to delete a row.

<Image
  title="Use a dashboard variable in the all three data flows for a single value column."
  src="/img/blog/2024-12-04-business-table-1.9.0/single.png"
/>

### Nested objects

Nested objects have four possible data flows:

- **Get Options**. Executed:
  - on the form load to populate the column from a data source.
- **Add Options**. Executed:
  - if the **Add Options** functionality is allowed,
  - after a user opens **Show All comments** drawer and clicks on the **Add** button.
- **Update Options**. Executed:
  - if the **Update Options** functionality is allowed,
  - after a user opens **Show All comments** drawer and clicks on the pencil button.
- **Delete Options**. Executed:
  - if the **Delete Options** functionality is allowed,
  - after a user opens **Show All comments** drawer and clicks on the trash can button.

/>

## Custom values in editable **select** type fields.

The **Select** is one of the types that you can use to add or edit a column value.

<Image
  title="The Select is one of the types that you can use to add or edit a column value."
  src="/img/blog/2024-12-04-business-table-1.9.0/select.png"
  width="40%"
/>

Starting from this release, in addition to selecting from a pre-populated drop-down list, a user can enter a custom value.

<Image
  title="If allowed, a user can enter a custom value in the prepopulated drop-down list while adding or editing a row."
  src="/img/blog/2024-12-04-business-table-1.9.0/select-new-value.gif"
/>

To allow that, ensure to set **Allow custom value** to ON.

<Image
  title="Allow custom values parameter in the Add data and Editable data for the select type column."
  src="/img/blog/2024-12-04-business-table-1.9.0/allow-custom-values.png"
/>

## New column types

A column type is specified in the **Layout** category and determines what the data looks like when displaying for a user review.

<Image
  title="Four new column types."
  src="/img/blog/2024-12-04-business-table-1.9.0/new-types.png"
/>

### Boolean

The **Boolean** type displays a checkmark in a circle for a `true` value and an empty circle for a `false` value.

<Image
  title="An example of the Boolean type in the Business Table panel."
  src="/img/blog/2024-12-04-business-table-1.9.0/boolean-type.png"
/>

### Image

The **Image** type interprets the image links and base64 formats.

<Image
  title="An example of the Image type in the Business Table panel."
  src="/img/blog/2024-12-04-business-table-1.9.0/image-type.png"
/>

```url

```

### Preformatted

The **Preformatted** type, which is similar to the `pre` HTML tag, is designed to display text with spaces and line breaks preserved. This means the text is shown exactly as it is written, without any formatting changes.

If the **Preformatted style** switch is ON, the text is displayed in the fixed-width font.
If the **Preformatted style** switch is off, the text is displayed in the font configured for the user's browser.

<Image
  title="An example of the Preformatted type in the Business Table panel."
  src="/img/blog/2024-12-04-business-table-1.9.0/pre-type.png"
/>

### Rich text

The **Rich text** type interprets sanitized HTML and Markdown.

<Image
  title="An example of the Rich Text type in the Business Table panel."
  src="/img/blog/2024-12-04-business-table-1.9.0/rich-type.png"
/>

HTML from the example above:

```html
<h3>Features/ 2</h3>
- Updated behavior <br />
- Added All options<br />
```

Markdown from the example above:

```markdown
This is the first line.\
And this is the second line.This is the first line.

And this is the second line.
```

## New editor types

An editor type is specified in the **Add Data** and **Editable Data** categories and determines what the data looks like when a user adds or edits the data, respectively.

### Text Area

The **Text Area** editor type is designed to add and edit multi-row text values.

<Image
  title="An example of the Text Area Editor type in the Business Table panel."
  src="/img/blog/2024-12-04-business-table-1.9.0/text-area-type.png"
/>

### Switch

The **Switch** editor type makes the user's work with the Business Table panel more intuitive while transforming the boolean type data into a switch that can be turned on and off.

<Image
  title="An example of the Switch Editor type in the Business Table panel."
  src="/img/blog/2024-12-04-business-table-1.9.0/switch-editor-type.png"
/>

## Default pagination size

With the **default pagination size** parameter, you configure how many rows per page are availabe when the dashboard loads for the first time. If a user changes that, it gets saved into the browser cookies for the user's convinience.

  src="/img/blog/2024-12-04-business-table-1.9.0/page-size.png"
