## Downloads

The Grafana Community greeted the Business Table panel with cheerful applause and grateful hollering. In the first two weeks of existence, the plugin has been downloaded almost half a thousand times! It is a terrific start for a new plugin with basic functionality. We are eager to learn what the features from this latest release will do with the downloads number! Stay tuned.

## Edit data and impose permission protection

That is a loaded feature requiring a comprehensive explanation. Hold on tight.

Here are some highlights:

- Every column has separate editable/permission settings.
- User can enter a new value manually or select from the predefined listing coming from your data source
- The Update Request (the request that takes user-entered values and transmits them into your data source, serving as a bridge between user input and data source) is configurable and allows custom logic
- The permission can be Grafana user-based (Viewer/Editor/Admin/None) or regulated from the backend

Editing and permissions settings are done in a new **Editable Data** category. All columns you add into the **Layout** category, you can further configure there.

<Image

  src="/img/blog/2024-09-26-business-table-1.3.0/category.png"
/>

To make a column editable, turn the appropriate switch on. With that the tag **Editable** appears next to the column name in the **Layout** category.

/>

### Editable column types

After your turn the editable switch ON, determine the type for the editable column. Depending on your choice, more parameters appear.

<Image

  src="/img/blog/2024-09-26-business-table-1.3.0/types.png"
  width="70%"
/>

You can choose between the following types:

- **String**. It allows a user to enter a value manually.
- **Number**. It allows a user to enter a numerical value manually. Optionally, you can specify the **Min** and **Max** for the allowed values.
- **Select**. It gives users a drop-down populated from the **Value Field** parameter. Optionally, you can specify **Label Field**. Both parameters, **Value field** and **Label Field**, come from the dataframe:column of your data source.
- **Datetime**. It allows a user to enter a value in the datetime format. Optionally, you can specify a range of allowed datetimes using **Set Min Date** and **Set Max Date** parameters.

### Update Request

Configure the Update Request (the request that takes user-entered values and transmits them into your data source, serving as a bridge between user input and data source) in the **Editable Data** -> **Setting** section.

First, select the data source where the updated values should go to. Then, choose the **Query Editor** mode. Your choice is:

- **Builder**. It uses the standard Grafana query builder.
- **Code**. It allows you to specify an update request query in a language appropriate for your data source.

### Permission

Every column in the Business Table visualization can have unique permissions for editing. Set the **Check** parameter to one of the following:

- **Always Allowed**. Every user has permission to edit the column.
- **By Org User Role**. With that, you need to specify which roles have permission to edit (**Editor**, **Viewer**, **Admin**, **None**).
- **By Backend**. With that, you need to specify a data frame column with a boolean value. If the value is **True**, a user has permission to edit. If the value is **False**, a user does NOT have permission to edit.

## Pagination feature

You have a choice of two pagination modes: **Client** and **Query**.

  src="/img/blog/2024-09-26-business-table-1.3.0/pagination.png"
/>

### Client

With the **Client** mode, all records are retrieved by the Business Table panel simultaneously and then divided into the pages by your browser. By default, ten rows per page are displayed. A user can change it to 20, 50, 100 or 1000.

The **Client** mode is the easiest and fastest to set up. However, users might experience performance issues since all data must be retrieved before being separated into pages.

  title="The Client pagination mode."
  src="/img/blog/2024-09-26-business-table-1.3.0/client.png"
/>

### Query

With the **Query** mode, only records needed for the current display are retrieved. That approach guarantees better performance for the end-users.

The determination of what records to retrieve (what records need to be displayed) is done by using the following metrics:

- **pageIndex**. Page order number. Specify as a dashboard variable name.
- **offset**. How many rows to skip starting from the first. Specify as a dashboard variable name.
- **pageSize**. The number of rows per page. Specify as a dashboard variable name.
- **Total Count Field**. Specify as a dataframe:column name. **Required**.

The necessity of the first three metrics (**pageIndex**, **offset**, **pageSize**) is contingent on the data source from which the data is sourced. Understanding this dependency will prepare you for efficient data retrieval.

In the example below, we use the Timescale data source, consequently SQL, to retrieve the data. **pageIndex** and **offset** are enough metrics in that case.

## Column Pin feature

It is a helpful feature for the wide tables. You can pin any column to always stay visible on the left or right.

Below, the column **Country** is pinned to the left.

## Download table data button

You can add a download button right on the Business Table visualization for an intuitive user experience.

## Support Grafana Data links

The Business Table visualization supports the Grafana's **Data links** feature. In the example below, when a user clicks on a row, two links are suggested in the popup window.

You can use the Grafana **Overrides** feature to configure column links (not for the whole row).
