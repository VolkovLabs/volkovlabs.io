In addition to the all-around columns/rows visualization functionality, the Business Table effortlessly combines with all other plugins from the Business Suite. [One example](/blog/business-table-1.2.0/#example) in this article is where we use the Business Variable and Business Table to facilitate user-intuitive filtering via panels' interconnectivity.  


The following data frame is used for the better features demonstration.

## Row grouping

This feature allows you to combine unique field values into groups and collapse/expanse using little arrows.

/>

## Multi tables as tabs

The Business Table panel allows you to have a multi-tabs view and configure the fields of each view separately. 

To add a new tab, use the **New Table** parameter.
To add a column to an existing tab, use the **New Column** parameter.

## Auto-width columns

The column width can be determined automatically within a specified range or explicitly hardcoded by a user in pixels.

## Colored Background (Thresholds)

The Business Table panel supports the Grafana **Thresholds** feature.

## Footer

Every column of the Business Table panel has the **Show in Footer** property. 
If at least one column has it set up, then the Footer will be shown. 

You can select the aggregation function separately for each column to be applied toward the value displayed in the Footer.

## Filtering

The Business Table panel starts strong with the filtering feature offering two main options:
 - Client, 
 - Query.

### Client 

Every column of the Business Table panel offers the **Filter** feature. If set to **Yes**, the funnel icon will appear next to the column header. 

With the **Filter Mode**->**Client**, when a user clicks on the funnel icon, depends on the value type they see the two types for further filtering.

- **Search**. It provides a form to type free text or enter a number value to use in the filtering.
- **Options**. It provides a multi-select list of all existing values in the column.

/>

### Query

This method of filtering allows panel interconnectivity or use in the data links. With the **Filter Mode**->**Query**, the displayed data is filtered according to the selected dashboard variables.

/>

#### Example 

You can go one step forward and enchance the visualization of your dashboard variables with the Business Variable panel. Below is an example of the displayed data change in the Business Table following the dashboard variable update via the Business Variable panel.

/>

You can combine Business Table with the [Business Variable](/plugins/business-variable) panel for variable selection.

## Sorting

Every column of the Business Table panel has the **Sort** property. If set to **Yes**, the ascending sorting icon appears next to the column header. After the user clicks on the icon, the order changes to descending.
