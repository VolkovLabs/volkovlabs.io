## Read-only Text Area

This new element type is similar to the previously existing read-only type, but this one allows to display multiple rows of text.

## Link Element

This new element type allows you to add links on your Data Manipulation form. The link text is customizable using the **Link Text** option. If not specified, link address will be displayed.

The link can be opened in the same or a new tab.

## Select Options from Query

Previously all types with Custom options supported only options entered manually during the configuration or set using Custom code. Starting from this release, you can reference a query from any configured data source.

You can specify the **Label** and **Value** fields.

## Data Source for the Reset button

Now you can specify a data source for the **Reset Request** and set payload.

## Confirmation Window

The Confirmation window, if enabled, is shown after a user clicks the submit button to highlight all changes made in the Data Manipulation form.

Starting from this release, you can customize all labels using the **Confirmation Window** section.

## Autosize Code Editor

Any option containing code (for instance, **Custom code**, **Show if returned value is true**) changes its size (number of rows) following the number of code rows in it. The smallest size is 10 rows of code which means the size will not shrink to be less than 10 rows. The size can increase up to 50 rows of code.
