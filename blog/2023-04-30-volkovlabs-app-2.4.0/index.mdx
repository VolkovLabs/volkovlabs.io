# Volkov Labs Application 2.4.0

We released a new version of the Volkov Labs Application 2.4.0 with a customized Grafana docker image. This maintenance release

- Updated to Grafana 9.5.1 toolkit.
- Updated to Grafana docker image 9.5.1.
- Updated the Application page and Home dashboard with an auto-scroll table.

:::info Grafana Catalog

Volkov Labs Application is for internal use and is not included in the Grafana Catalog.

:::

We share the project with the community as an example of how to deploy [a customized Docker image with included Application plugin and provisioning](https://github.com/volkovlabs/volkovlabs-app).

## Grafana 9.5.1

Grafana 9.5.0/9.5.1 introduced Connections as a new and easier way to install and add Data Sources. It's an interesting feature to explore various data sources, but we already know what we need and disabled it.

Other notable changes in the [Docker file](https://github.com/VolkovLabs/volkovlabs-app/blob/main/Dockerfile):

- Top navigation and Chrome UI features are enabled by default and were removed.
- Commands to replace JavaScripts were updated according to the latest changes.

## Customization

Months of work bundled with deep expertise nicely wrapped into a 7-minute long video revealing simple steps to customize Grafana. In this tutorial, we answered all community questions we collected to this moment.

## Home Dashboard

The home dashboard, which we provisioned with data sources, displays the latest videos from our YouTube channel and blog posts. It is based on the [RSS/Atom Data Source](/plugins/volkovlabs-rss-datasource) and improved [Dynamic Text panel](/plugins/volkovlabs-dynamictext-panel).
