## Local mode

With the <b>Local</b> request mode, the Business Satellite data source connects to the local configuration storage using the same Grafana privileges a user has been assigned during login and, thus, simplifies the access policy.

The <b>Local</b> request mode has no parameters.

With the <b>Remote</b> request mode, the privileges are taken from the token and might differ from those assigned during login into Grafana.

## Values in Annotations

Starting from this release, the HTTP API data source digests the <b>Values</b> field from the Annotations's text.

As shown below, you can always use transformations to have one value per column format.

## Organization Users

**Request** in the query editor is a drop-down parameter that appears when you connect your panel
to the HTTP API data source. In addition to all existing options, we added
**Organization Users**. The picture below illustrates the new possibility.
