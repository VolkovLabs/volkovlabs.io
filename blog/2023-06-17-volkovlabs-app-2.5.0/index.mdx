- Updated to major Grafana version 10.0.0.

:::info Grafana Catalog

Volkov Labs App is for internal use and is not included in the Grafana Catalog.

We share this project with the community as an example of how to create [a customized Docker image with included Application plugin and provisioning](https://github.com/volkovlabs/volkovlabs-app).

## Grafana 10.0.0

Major Grafana version 10.0.0 was released at GrafanaCON 2023. It has many visual and functional improvements.

We tested and updated all commands in the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/VolkovLabs/volkovlabs-app/blob/main/Dockerfile) for the latest Grafana release 10.0.0.

## Customization

Months of work bundled with deep expertise nicely wrapped into a 7-minute long video revealing simple steps to customize Grafana. In this tutorial, we answered all community questions we collected to this moment.

## Update Navigation (Mega) Menu

The mega menu is the left-side menu added in Grafana 9.5. It's hard-coded and there is no way to update it in the UI.

The menu elements can be added using JavaScript when rendering. We used the existing command for updating the Help menu to set the `nav` variable.

```docker
## Update Help menu
RUN sed -i "s|\[\[.NavTree\]\],|nav,|g; \
    s|window.grafanaBootData = {| \
    let nav = [[.NavTree]]; \
    nav[nav.length -1]['subTitle'] = 'Application'; \
    window.grafanaBootData = {|g" \
    /usr/share/grafana/public/views/index.html

## Add News to the Mega Menu
RUN sed -i "s|window.grafanaBootData = {| \
    nav.push({\"id\":\"my-dashboard\",\"text\":\"Volkov Labs News\",\"icon\":\"play\",\"url\":\"/d/O4tc_E6Gz\",\"sortWeight\":-2000}); \
    window.grafanaBootData = {|g" \
    /usr/share/grafana/public/views/index.html
```
