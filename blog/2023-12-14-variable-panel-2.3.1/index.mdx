## Clear **Search values** after switching tabs

This feature is applicable when your Variable panel displays multiple tabs.

In the example below, the variable panel displays two tabs: **Location** and **Country**. When a user clicks a funnel icon and types in the **Search values**, only the nodes containing, in this example, 5 are shown.

Next, if this user switches to the **Country** tab, the **Search values** are cleared and no filters are applied.

That means that when a user changes tabs, all previous **Search values** are removed.

The same rule applies to the **Favorites**. The **Show only favorites** filter is cleared when a user switches to another tab.

### Persistent Mode

This feature is applicable when Variable configured in Minimized and Button layouts. This mode could be turned on and off in the Variable panel options.

/>

When **Enabled**, the selected values are stored in the browser's local storage. It comes in handy when one variable panel is controlled by the other variable panel.

For instance, in the illustration below, I have two variable panels. One displays countries and the other one displays states within the selected country. I chose **USA** in the first panel and then **IL** on the other panel.

Depending on the **Persistent** option value set for the **State** variable panel, the selected value is either <u>saved</u> in the browser for future use or <u>not</u>.
