# Business Intelligence App 1.2.0

We are excited to announce the release of the Business Intelligence App, version 1.2.0. At this early stage, it is a proof-of-concept, meaning a product created as a starter to vastly extend its functionality in the future.
This release includes the following updates:

- Improved the Alerting panel.
- Added regex patterns for alerts.
- New for webhooks: added test connectivity and a new **Use by Default** parameter.

## Proof of Concept

Business Intelligence App is a proof-of-concept project with an expected launch in January 2024. It will include the following components:

- Alerting,
- High performance Engine,
- Reporting (Q1 2024),
- Dashboard management (Q1 2024),
- Forecasting (Q2 2024).

## Alerting panel improvements

The latest version of the Alerting panel is depicted below. This panel is designed to simplify work with alerts by having all controls in one place and having an intuitive order of configuration settings.

The creation logic follows the Grafana [alerting basics](/big/big-alerting/).

### Alert card

Every alert on the Alerting panel has a sleek card with the title, the panel name it evaluates, schedule details, statuses and action buttons.

### Statuses

There are two statuses for each alert. One indicates whether the alert is **Active** or has been **Paused**.

And the other status might be one of the four values:

- **Scheduled**. The alert is scheduled, but never run yet.
- **OK**. The alert has been run and the thresholds are NOT breached or the regex pattern is NOT found.
- **Alerting**. The alert has been run and the thresholds are being breached or the regex pattern is found.
- **Error**. Something is wrong, which could be the query, annotation or webhook.

Right after an alert is created it becomes **Active** and **Scheduled**. Any active alert could be paused. After any change, the alert status changes to **Scheduled**.

### Action buttons

Four action buttons are available:

- **Info**. Open the drawer with the alert details.
- **Pause/Active**. Set the alert to pause or active mode.
- **Edit**. Opens the Edit drawer. When you click in the Edit drawer, the alert status changes to Scheduled.
- **Delete**. Delete the alert after the user's confirmation.

## Regex Pattern

The regex pattern evaluation is a new evaluation option. The alert evaluation could be set to Thresholds or a Regex Pattern:

- **Thresholds**. The alert examines data against the specified thresholds in the panel options.
- **Regex Pattern**. The alert examines the specified fields (optional) and searches the specified pattern.

The Evaluation section is shown in the picture above.

## Webhook updates

### Test connectivity

You can test connectivity in the Edit Webhook drawer using the red button at the bottom.

### Use by Default

You can set any webhook to be assigned by default, meaning, when a webhook is not specified, the default one is executed.

### Docker Compose

The `docker-compose.yml` file consists of the following containers:

- **Grafana** includes the provisioned BI Engine data source, an Alerting panel, and a demo dashboard.
- **Timescale** is required to store configuration, events, rules, etc.
- **BI Engine** has a service account key to access Grafana HTTP APIs. It evaluates alert rules and calls webhooks when alert statuses change.
- **JSON webhook** is a webhook example based on NodeJS, which accepts alert payload and saves it to the files for testing purposes.
- **Node-RED** provides an HTTP POST endpoint and sends a Slack notification with alert details.
- **Data Generator** generates test data for threshold evaluation in the demo dashboard.

### Start

When you run a docker-compose file, it launches the Grafana, Timescale, BI Engine and Webhook containers:

```
docker compose pull && docker compose up
```

### Stop

Stop and remove all containers:

```
docker compose down
```
