# Apache ECharts Panel 4.3.0/4.3.1

We are happy to announce the release of Apache ECharts Panel 4.3.0/4.3.1. This release include the following updates:

- Added an alert state and annotations.
- <del>
    Added the `getDataSourceSrv` parameter to retrieve the entry point to data
    sources.
  </del>
- Updated U.S. and world maps in the GeoJSON module.
- Updated the plugin to the latest Grafana 9.4.7 toolkit and the Apache ECharts 5.4.2 library.

:::info Grafana Plugins catalog
After the plugin review by the Grafana team, the `getDataSourceSrv` parameter was removed due to security reasons in v4.3.1.

The plugin was updated in the Grafana Plugins catalog on April 24, 2023.

## 100k downloads

We are pleased to announce that Apache ECharts Panel has been downloaded over 100,000 times. This extension is not a plug-and-play product and requires some learning. Our [YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Uj1n4Cr88&list=PLPow72ygztmQHGWFqksEf3LebUfhqBfFu) and [documentation](/plugins/volkovlabs-echarts-panel) will undoubtedly assist you in mastering the plugin and revealing its unrivaled customization potential.

## Alert State and Annotations

We added support for Annotations in Apache ECharts using mark lines. Data for mark lines is retrieved from the `data.annotations` object as explained in the [product documentation](/plugins/volkovlabs-echarts-panel/annotations/).

```js
const annotations = [];
data.annotations.map((a) => {
  a.source.forEach((source) =>
    annotations.push({
      xAxis: source.time,
      label: source.text,
      lineStyle: {
        color: source.color,
        width: 2,
      },
    })
  );
});

/**
 * Data Sources
 */
const series = data.series.map((s) => {
  const sData =
    s.fields.find((f) => f.type === "number").values.buffer ||
    s.fields.find((f) => f.type === "number").values;
  const sTime =
    s.fields.find((f) => f.type === "time").values.buffer ||
    s.fields.find((f) => f.type === "time").values;

  return {
    name: s.refId,
    type: "line",
    showSymbol: false,
    areaStyle: {
      opacity: 0.1,
    },
    lineStyle: {
      width: 1,
    },
    data: sData.map((d, i) => [sTime[i], d.toFixed(2)]),
    markLine: {
      data: annotations,
      label: {
        show: false,
      },
      symbol: ["none", "none"],
    },
  };
});
```

## Entry point to data sources

:::info Security

After the plugin review by the Grafana team, this functionality was removed due to security reasons in v4.3.1.

We are testing a security-safe technique in the Data Manipulation plugin and plan to include it into Apache ECharts Panel.
:::

Apache ECharts Panel allows you to retrieve an entry point of a data source. You can use the data source instance to perform any methods supplied by the data source.

```js
async () => {
  const targets = data.request?.targets;
  if (targets.length && targets[0].datasource) {
    const datasource = await getDataSourceSrv().get(targets[0].datasource);
    notifySuccess(["PostgreSQL Version", await datasource.getVersion()]);
  }
};
```

## GeoJSON updates

GeoJSON files (U.S. and world maps) were synchronized with native maps provided within Grafana GeoMap. You may now quickly transition from GeoMap to Apache ECharts Panel to display visual maps, like we already did for the [Website Analytics blog](/blog/documentation-updates-20230214/).

## Panel Variables

We continue to explore with integrating DOM components straight into the Apache ECharts container to add more interactivity. This time, we introduced a dropdown box that lets you update Apache ECharts or establish a direct interaction with the data source through an entry point.

## YouTube Tutorial

The Apache ECharts Panel plugin is a data visualization extension for Grafana that allows you to integrate charts and graphs from the popular Apache ECharts library into your Grafana dashboard.
