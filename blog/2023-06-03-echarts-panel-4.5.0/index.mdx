We released a new version of the Apache ECharts Panel 4.5.0 for Grafana. This maintenance release

- Tested with Grafana 10 Preview.
- Example function was updated to support Grafana 10.

## Changes in Grafana 10

Some data sources in Grafana 10 return field values as `values` instead of `values.buffer` as in Grafana 9 and before. We updated the example function to work in Grafana 9 and Grafana 10:

```
  const sData = s.fields.find((f) => f.type === 'number').values.buffer || s.fields.find((f) => f.type === 'number').values;
  const sTime = s.fields.find((f) => f.type === 'time').values.buffer || s.fields.find((f) => f.type === 'time').values;
```

You can remove the `||` statement and choose the correct expression for your Grafana version.

## Custom Theme

We added an alert for theme parsing errors. JSON errors can be hard to spot and the theme won't be applied until all errors are fixed.

A new alert makes the troubleshooting process effortless.
