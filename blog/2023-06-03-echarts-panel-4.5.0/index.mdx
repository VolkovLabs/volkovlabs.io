# Apache ECharts Panel 4.5.0 supports Grafana 10

We are happy to announce the release of Apache ECharts Panel 4.5.0. This release includes the following updates:

- Tested the plugin with Grafana 10 Preview.
- Updated the function example to support Grafana 10.
- Added an alert for custom theme parsing errors.
- Migrated to Plugin Tools 1.5.2 with Node 18 and npm.

:::info Grafana Plugins catalog
The plugin was updated in the Grafana Plugins catalog on June 15, 2023.

## Changes in Grafana 10

Some data sources in Grafana 10 return field values as `values` instead of `values.buffer` as in Grafana 9 and prior versions. We updated the function example to work in Grafana 9 and Grafana 10:

```
  const sData = s.fields.find((f) => f.type === 'number').values.buffer || s.fields.find((f) => f.type === 'number').values;
  const sTime = s.fields.find((f) => f.type === 'time').values.buffer || s.fields.find((f) => f.type === 'time').values;
```

You can remove the `||` statement and choose the correct expression for your Grafana version.

## Custom Themes

We added an alert for theme parsing errors. It may be difficult to identify JSON errors when applying a modified theme until all issues are resolved.

A new alert makes the troubleshooting process simpler and more effective.
