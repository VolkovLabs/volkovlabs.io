## Distributed High Availability

One of the most requested capabilities is the High Availability (HA) setup. We designed the BI App specifically keeping that in mind.

All BI App system components could exist in clusters, where a cluster is a set of mirrored servers. It is done to primarily facilitate uninterrupted service by distributing the load most efficiently.

- BI Engine Cluster:
  - Requests to Server API are distributed behind the Load Balancer.
  - Schedulers distribute alert rules automatically.
- Grafana Cluster visualizes data and provides HTTP API for BI Engine to retrieve configuration and data.
- Prometheus Cluster stores BI Engine performance data.
- PostgreSQL Cluster stores:
  - BI Engine database.
  - Grafana configuration database.
  - Production data.

Below is the picture to illustrate the current HA setup.

## Swagger REST API

Starting from this release, you can use the Swagger REST API to automate configuration and get data from BI Engine. The detailed instructions are available in the [REST API](/big/api/) section of our documentation.

## UI Updates

### Duplicate Alert

We added one more action button. Now you can create a new alert using a previously created one as a template.

### Dashboard Refresh

Until this release, with every dashboard refresh, the add/edit drawer was automatically closing. That imposed challenges with adding/editing an alert rule when the refresh time was less than 2-3 minutes.
With this update, the add/edit window stays up regardless of the dashboard refresh periodicity.

### CRON Validator

We improved the CRON format validation. After this change, you will always see an error if the format you entered is erroneous.

### Custom variable values

Grafana supports a wide range of data sources. From the beginning, we ensured the compatibility between the BI Engine and SQL and Prometheus data sources. We are actively working on ensuring many other data sources are compatible.

However, in the case when variables for your particular data source are not yet supported, we allow to specify variable values directly on the Add/Edit alert drawer.

## Getting Started

You can download the Development release from our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/volkovlabs/volkovlabs-bi-grafana) and follow this hands-on tutorial.

### Docker Compose

The `docker-compose.yml` file consists of the following containers:

- **Grafana** includes the provisioned BI Engine data source, an Alerting panel, and dashboards.
- **Timescale** is required to store configuration, events, rules, etc.
- **BI Engine** has a service account key to access Grafana HTTP APIs. It evaluates alert rules and calls webhooks when alert statuses change.
- **JSON webhook** is a webhook example based on NodeJS, which accepts alert payload and saves it to the files for testing purposes.
- **Prometheus** collects and store performance metrics from BI Engine.

<Code
  url="https://github.com/VolkovLabs/volkovlabs-bi-grafana/blob/main/docker-compose.yml"
  language="yaml"
/>

### Start

When you run a docker-compose file, it launches the Grafana, Timescale, BI Engine, Prometheus and Webhook containers:

```sh
docker compose pull && docker compose up
```

### Stop

Stop and remove all containers:

```sh
docker compose down
```
