# Business Intelligence App 1.7.0

We are excited to announce the release of the Business Intelligence App, version 1.7.0.

The Business Intelligence App, version 1.7.0 includes the following updates:

- Added distributed High Availability.
- Added Swagger REST API documentation.
- UI updates: Copy Alert, dashboard refresh, cron validator, custom Variable values.

## Distributed High Availability

One of the most requested capabilities is the high-availability(HA) setup. We designed the BI App specifically keeping that in mind.

All BI App system components could exist in clusters, where a cluster is a set of mirrored servers. It is done to primarily facilitate uninterrupted service by distributing the load most efficiently.

- BI Engine Cluster:
  - Requests to Server API are distributed behind Load Balancer.
  - Schedulers distribute alert rules automatically.
- Grafana Cluster visualizes data and provides HTTP API for BI Engine to retrieve configuration and data.
- Prometheus Cluster stores BI Engine performance data.
- PostgreSQL Cluster stores:
  - BI Engine database.
  - Grafana configuration database.
  - Production data.

### Docker Compose

The `docker-compose.yml` file consists of the following containers:

- **Grafana** includes the provisioned BI Engine data source, an Alerting panel, and dashboards.
- **Timescale** is required to store configuration, events, rules, etc.
- **BI Engine** has a service account key to access Grafana HTTP APIs. It evaluates alert rules and calls webhooks when alert statuses change.
- **JSON webhook** is a webhook example based on NodeJS, which accepts alert payload and saves it to the files for testing purposes.
- **Prometheus** collects and store performance metrics from BI Engine.

```
docker compose pull && docker compose up
```
