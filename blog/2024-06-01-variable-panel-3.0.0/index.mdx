## Business Variable Panel

The Variable panel joins the [Business Suite](/plugins/) for Grafana and with that gets an elevated name. Now, the same amazing open source plugin is called the Business Variable panel.

Please welcome the new name for the same functionality!

## Maximum visible values

**Maximum visible values** is a new parameter added to the **Values** section. It is available when the **Business Variable**->**Display mode** is set to **Minimize**.

This parameter is helpful when your users select several options in the variable panel, as shown below (print screen on the left). In that event, the variable panel might take up too much screen space and distort the dashboard layout.

You have the flexibility to set the maximum number of visible on-screen options to avoid that.

For instance, in the picture below (print-screen on the right), the **Maximum visible values** parameter is set to 3, and the Business Variable panel looks more like what you expect from the **Minimize** mode - one line. Three options are left: Singapore, Stockholm, and Tokyo. The remaining are collected into (+21).

  src="/img/blog/2024-06-01-variable-panel-3.0.0/max-visible-value.png"
/>

## Manual entry

When in the **Minimize** display mode, you can allow users to enter the values to be selected manually.

The new parameter is called **Allow custom values** and is located in the **Values** section. Set it to **Enabled** to allow manual entry. By default, it is set to **Disabled**

  title="Manual data entry is possible when the new parameter is enabled."

The **Allow Custom values** parameter is available for the **Minimize** display mode.

/>

## Total and selected values count

In the **Table** display mode, you can now choose to **Display total and selected values count for multi-select variables**. The **Header** must be in the **Display** mode to see the new parameter.

The new parameter is the enable/disable type. The total count appears next to the header in a gray font color where the first number indicates how many values are selected and the second how many are available for selection in total.

<Image
  title="New parameter: Total and selected values."
  src="/img/blog/2024-06-01-variable-panel-3.0.0/total.png"
/>

## Slider display mode

The **Slider** is a new **Display mode** under the **Business Variable** section.

<Image
  title="Slider is a new Display mode."
  src="/img/blog/2024-06-01-variable-panel-3.0.0/slider-mode.png"
  width="50%"
/>

When a dashboard variable contains a massive volume of values and only one selected value is logically acceptable, the **Slider** display mode is your way to go. For instance, a user needs to choose a year as shown below. A standard alternative (long dropdown list) is shown for comparison.

<Image
  title="Slider mode is a new way of selecting a single value from a long list."
  src="/img/blog/2024-06-01-variable-panel-3.0.0/slider.gif"
/>

:::info

The **Slider** display mode works only for the Single-value dashboard variables.

:::

Text values also could be displayed using the **Slide** display mode.

## Multi-tab view improvements

### Tab auto-grouping

The ability to auto group tab adds even more sophistication to the Business Variable panel. When too many tabs are located side by side, the panel collects the overflowing tabs and shows the three vertical dots instead. Upon clicking on the dots, a user sees the rest of the tabs in a drop-down for selection.

The Business Variable panel shifts the selected tab on the very left among all other tabs.

<Image
  title="Auto tab grouping and shifting the selected tab to the left."
  src="/img/blog/2024-06-01-variable-panel-3.0.0/tab.png"
/>

### Selected tab preservation

You might have the cloned Business Variable panel across many dashboards. With that, a user can [switch to a different dashboard](/blog/variable-panel-2.2.0-20231130/#dashboard-redirect-option) without realizing it. To enhance the user experience even further, you can now save the selected tab while redirecting a user and open a new dashboard with the tab that the user selected prior.

To configure the preservation of the selected tab, you need the **Selected group id** parameter from the **Groups** section. Choose a unique word and specify it across all dashboards where you have the Business Variable panel and need to preserve the selected tab.

In the illustration below, you can see three different dashboards with an identical Business Variable panel on each. All three Business Variable panels have the same word _device_ in the **Selected group id** parameter.

## Advanced. Select dependent variable to reset

The **Select dependent variable to reset** option is for advanced Business Variable panel users. This option is created to jump over some default Grafana functionality.

Grafana saves the dashboard variable values for better performance and reuses them whenever possible. This is majorly helpful. However, there are some scenarios when it is not aligned with the best user experience.

To better understand the new parameter, first, outline the participating concepts:

- _dashboard variable_,
- _dashboard variable query_,
- _selected current value_,
- _dashboard variable refresh/update_,
- _dashboard variable reset_.

A [_dashboard variable_](/grafana/variables/) usually is a set of values retrieved following the rules set by a dashboard developer. Though, there could be many possible ways to set the rules, for simplicity, let's call them all a _dashboard variable query_.

A _dashboard variable_ might have a _selected current value_ (or values).

A _dashboard variable refresh/update_ is when the _dashboard variable query_ is called to retrieve the whole set of values. If previously the _selected current value_ existed, Grafana specifies it as well right after the refresh/update.

Thus, there are two steps in the _dashboard variable refresh/update_.

The **Select dependent variable to reset** option instructs Grafana to perform only the first step: to rerun the _dashboard variable query_ and omit the second step, meaning NOT to assign a _selected current value_.

The first step without the second is called _dashboard variable reset_.

With all that in mind, we can define what **Select dependent variable to reset** option does.

It links two _dashboard variables_ and instructs Grafana to reset one of them after the value of the first one is changed.

The two scenarios below provide use-case examples of when the _dashboard variable reset_ is needed.

### Scenario 1

In this scenario, we have two dashboard variables:

- `device` which is populated by the query

```sql
 select name from device_time;
```

- `type` which is populated by the query that is dependent on the first variable

```
select value from device_time where name='$device';
```

<Image
  title="Two dashboard variables. One is dependent on the other."
  src="/img/blog/2024-06-01-variable-panel-3.0.0/reset-var.png"
/>

With this configuration, whenever the `device` variable is updated (a value is selected in the dashboard drop-down, etc.), the other variable `type` automatically gets refreshed/updated. That means that the query to populate the `type` variable is run with every `device` variable value update.

Let's say that some of the values of the `type` variable overlap. In the example below, we have:

```text
 - device 1, type in ('1', '2', '3'),
 - device 2, type in ('2', '3'),
 - device 3, type in ('3'),
```

The value '3' is common for all devices. The value '2' is shared by device 1 and device 2 and the value '1' is unique for the first device.

<Image
  title="Some of the values of the `type` variable overlap between devices."
  src="/img/blog/2024-06-01-variable-panel-3.0.0/values.png"
/>

If you set `type` to '3', then with switching devices in the `device` variable, you will always see '3' in the `type` variable. The `type` variable gets refreshed/updated (the underlying query is rerun), and following that Grafana will set it to '3' (to the previously selected value).

<Image
  title="In case of the overlapping values, Grafana sets the common value."
  src="/img/blog/2024-06-01-variable-panel-3.0.0/reset-no.gif"
  width="60%"
/>

If you set `type` to 1 (not overlapping value, the value '1' is unique to one device), then with every switch of the `device` variable, the `type` gets refreshed/updated (the underlying query is rerun) and the first retrieved value is displayed. Grafana can not set to the value selected previously since there is no such value for device 2, and for device 3.

<Image
  title="In case of no overlapping values, the first from the query result is displayed."
  src="/img/blog/2024-06-01-variable-panel-3.0.0/reset-yes.gif"
  width="60%"
/>

The **Select dependent variable to reset** parameter ensures that overlapping values do not matter.

The variable name you specify in the **Select dependent variable to reset** always will be _reset_ and the value to display will be taken from the first retrieved, not from the previous selections.

### Scenario 2

Variables do not have to depend on each other. In this scenario, the `type` variable has the **Custom** type. The values are specified directly separated by a comma.

<Image
  title="Two independent dashboard variables."
  src="/img/blog/2024-06-01-variable-panel-3.0.0/comma.png"
/>

With the **Custom** dashboard variable type, two dashboard variables are not linked in any way and act independently. This means the refresh/update of the `device` variable does nothing to the `type` variable.

In this scenario, using the new **Select dependent variable to reset** parameter is the only option to trigger the `type` variable reset following the `device` variable refresh/update.

## Improved Tree View display mode

In this release, we paid close attention to the user experience. We smoothed the scroll, worked on performance in general and improved a lot of little things.

## Grafana 10 and Grafana 11

:::warning Breaking changes
Grafana 9 is not supported.
:::

Our plugins always follow the latest Grafana versions and stay compatible with the most recent releases. That means, however, that we have to sunset the support of obsolete releases.

The latest Business Variable Panel 3.0.0 fully supports Grafana 10 and the upcoming 11 releases.

<GettingStarted />

## YouTube Tutorial

The Business Variable panel builds on top of the regular dashboard variables. It allows you to have dashboard filters in a separate panel which you can place anywhere on the dashboard.

The variable panel offers you single- and multi-variable layouts along with an advanced Tree View.
