## Layout

The new **Buttons Only** layout does not require any elements and allows performing update requests.

The panel padding can be adjusted within the range of 0 to 20 pixels depending on your use case.

## Select and Radio options

For the select boxes and radio buttons, you can configure the format type (string or number) to correctly visualize returned values and update them using API.

## Lookup for Read-only (Disabled) elements

We added a lookup for read-only form elements similar to radio buttons and select boxes to implement control forms and verify initial values before updating.

### Control Form

A control form is a special form with multiple sections consisting of read-only and input fields.
