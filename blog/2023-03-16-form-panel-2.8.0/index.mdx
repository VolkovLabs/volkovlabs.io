Padding can be decreased or increased from 0 to 20 pixels depending on your use case.

## Select and Radio options

The Select and Radio options can be set as a string or a number type to correctly visualize returned value and update using API.

## Lookup for Read-only (Disabled) elements

We added a lookup for Read-only elements similar to Radio and Select elements to implement control forms and verify initial values before updating.
