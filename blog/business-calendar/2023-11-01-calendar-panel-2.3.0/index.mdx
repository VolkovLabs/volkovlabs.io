# Internationalization, Yearly View, and More in Business Calendar 2.3.1

We’re thrilled to announce the release of **Business Calendar 2.3.1** for Grafana! This update brings exciting new features and enhancements to help you visualize and manage events more effectively. Here's what's new:

- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Support for English, Spanish, French, German, and Chinese.
- **Big Calendar Enhancements**:
  - New **Yearly View** for a comprehensive annual overview.
  - **Default View** option to set your preferred calendar layout.
  - **Scroll to Time** feature for better navigation in Day and Week views.

Let’s dive into the details of these updates and see how they can improve your workflow.

## Internationalization (i18n)

With Business Calendar 2.3.1, language barriers are a thing of the past. The panel now supports multiple languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, and Chinese. The language is automatically detected from your Grafana user profile and applied across the dashboard and panel options in edit mode.

## Yearly View for Big Calendar

We’ve added a **Yearly View** to the Big Calendar type, displaying all 12 months at once. This view is perfect for high-level planning and quick navigation to any day or month of the year.

## Default View for Big Calendar

Set your preferred calendar layout with the new **Default View** option. Whether you prefer Day, Week, Month, or Year, your calendar will load in your chosen view after every page refresh.

## Scroll to Time Option for Big Calendar

Navigating Day and Week views is now easier with the **Scroll to Time** feature. Specify a time, and the calendar will ensure it’s always visible, whether you’re scrolling within the panel or the browser window.

There are two scenarios to consider:

1. **Browser Window Scrolling**: If the panel is larger than your browser window, the specified time may be considered "visible" by the panel but not in your viewport.
2. **Panel Scrolling**: If the panel fits within your browser window, the calendar scrolls internally to display the specified time.
