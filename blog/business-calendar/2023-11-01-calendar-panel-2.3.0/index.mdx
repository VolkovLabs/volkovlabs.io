# Internationalization, yearly view, and scroll to time in Business Calendar 2.3.1

We are happy to announce the release of the Business Calendar panel 2.3.1. This release includes the following updates.

- Added Internationalization(i18n), supported languages include English, Spanish, French, German, and Chinese.

For the **Big Calendar** type:

- Added the **Year** view.
- Added **Default View** option.
- Added **Scroll To Time** option.

## Internationalization

The language you specify in the user profile menu will be used throughout the Business Calendar panel on the dashboard as well as in the edit mode for panel options.

## Year for Big Calendar

For the Big Calendar type, we added one more View option **Year**. It displays 12 months at the same time. The purpose of this view is to help navigate throughout the calendar since it makes it easier to jump into any day and month of the year.

If you need any particular information to be displayed in the Year view, please, let us know.

## Default view for Big Calendar

With this setting, you can control what your calendar will look like after a page refresh. Any of the calendar views can be selected as a default view.

## Scroll to Time option for Big Calendar

This setting applies to the Day and Week views. The Calendar panel ensures that the specified in this option time is always visible.

Please, note, that there could be two visibility scenarios.

One is when the Calendar panel itself is stretched out to a bigger size than your browser window. In that case, the panel might consider the specified time visible when it is not visible to you. The scrolling in that scenario scrolls a browser window. Scenario 1 is in the picture below.

Another scenario is when the Calendar panel itself is fully visible in your browser window, but the calendar has to be scrolled within the panel. In that event, the Scroll to Time option takes effect. Scenario 2 is in the picture below.
