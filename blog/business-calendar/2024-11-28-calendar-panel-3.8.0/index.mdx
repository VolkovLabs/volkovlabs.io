## Unprecedented Growth: Downloads Surge

The Business Calendar plugin has seen incredible growth, with community interest doubling since October 2024. In November alone, downloads reached **half a million**, compared to 250,000 in September. We’re approaching **4 million total downloads** on the Grafana Catalog!

What’s fascinating is that while documentation and tutorial videos see moderate engagement, downloads continue to skyrocket. This suggests that Business Calendar is not only in high demand but also intuitive and easy to configure.

## New Feature: Year View for Events

The **Year View** is a game-changer for visualizing events over a longer time frame. In this view, events are represented as dots for each day they occur. If a day has more than three events, a "+" symbol appears to indicate additional events.

For **multi-day events**, a dot is displayed for each day of the event. For example, an event spanning September 16 to 17 will show a dot on both days, making it easy to track duration at a glance.

## Enhanced Internationalization: Panel-Specific Date/Time Formats

Previously, the Business Calendar panel allowed users to override Grafana’s global language settings (found in **User > Profile > Preferences > Language**) via the **Layout > Date and Time Format** option. With version 3.8.0, this customization is now **panel-specific**, meaning each Business Calendar panel on a dashboard can have its own unique format.

New format options include **English 24** and **ISO 8601**, giving you even more flexibility to tailor the display to your needs.

:::info Why This Matters
Panel-specific formats are ideal for dashboards used by international teams,
allowing each panel to cater to different regional preferences without
affecting others.
