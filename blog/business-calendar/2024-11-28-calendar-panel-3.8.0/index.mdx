# Year view, improved internationalization and Grafana 11.3 Scenes updates in Business Calendar 3.8.0

We are happy to announce the release of the Business Calendar panel 3.8.0. This release includes the following updates:

- Single and multi-day events are displayed in the **Year** view.
- Panel-specific language(datetime) format is now supported.
- Compatibility with Grafana 11.3 and Scenes powered dashboards.

<Catalog date="October 31, 2024" />

## Downloads

The Community interest to the Business Calendar plugin has doubled since the end of October 2024. Half of the million downloads in November compared to a quarter million in September. The total downloads are getting closer to 4,000,000.

This plugin has intriguing statistics. The documentation and videos spark little interest while downloads skyrocket. I conclude that the plugin is in huge demand while being mostly self-explanatory in how to configure it.

## Year view

In the **Year** view, the Business Calendar panel displays dots representing events that day. If there are more than 3 events, the plus symbol is shown.

The multi-day events are displayed as one dot per day. For instance, if an event lasts from September 16 to September 17 (two day event), two dots are shown on the panel, one dot for September 16 and the other dot for September 17.

## Panel-specific language(datetime) format

As previously was described for the prior versions, the Business Calendar panel has the ability to override the Grafana's **User**->**Profile**->**Preferences**->**Language** setting in the **Layout**->**Date and time format** parameter. In addition to all existing options, a user of the Business Calendar panel can choose **English 24** and **ISO 8601**.

Starting from this release, the **Date and time format** parameter is specific to the particualr Business Calendar panel, not to all Business Calendar panels on the dashboard at once.

## Compatibility with Grafana 11.3 and Scenes powered dashboards

The [Scenes powered dashboards in Grafana 11.3 release](https://grafana.com/blog/2024/10/31/grafana-dashboards-are-now-powered-by-scenes-big-changes-same-ui/) introduced some breaking changes for our plugins. 

Starting from release 3.8.0, the Business Calendar panel fully migrated to support Grafana 11.3.
