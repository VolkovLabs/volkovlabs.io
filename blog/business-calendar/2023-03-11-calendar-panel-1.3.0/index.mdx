## Watch the Configuration Tutorial

Learn how to configure the Business Calendar panel in Grafana with our latest video tutorial. We demonstrate using a PostgreSQL database for event storage, but the plugin supports any Grafana-compatible data source.

## Understanding Event Types and Duration

Events in Business Calendar are classified into four distinct types based on their duration and time fields:

1. **Instantaneous**: Events with only a start time (e.g., a quick alert or notification).
2. **Continuing**: Events with both start and end times within the same day.
3. **Multi-Day**: Events spanning two or more days with defined start and end times.
4. **Ongoing**: Events with a start time but no defined end time (e.g., an open task).

## Multi-Day Events: Seamless Weekly Alignment

We’ve refined how multi-day events are displayed. In version 1.3.0, events spanning multiple days are aligned by week, eliminating awkward gaps even for events lasting over a week. Events are also ordered chronologically, with the earliest at the top for intuitive navigation.

## Flexible Event Coloring

Color customization has been significantly improved. If no Color field is specified in your data, you can now color events based on their **Event ID** or **Frame ID**. Additionally, you can select the **classic palette** in the plugin settings for a familiar look and feel.

## Enhanced Event Details

Event details are now more user-friendly:

- **Label Splitting**: Comma-separated values in the Labels field are split for clarity in the event drawer.
- **HTML Support**: Format event descriptions using HTML in the Description field for richer content.
- **Annotation Tags**: Tags from annotations are displayed as labels for quick reference.
