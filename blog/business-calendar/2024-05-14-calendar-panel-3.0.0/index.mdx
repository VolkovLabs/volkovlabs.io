## A New Name: Business Calendar Panel

As part of our ongoing efforts to align our plugins under the [Business Suite](/plugins/) for Grafana, the Calendar panel has been rebranded to the **Business Calendar panel**. This name better reflects its purpose and capabilities while maintaining the same robust functionality our community loves.

## Big Calendar: The Future of Event Visualization

Since introducing the [Big Calendar library](https://jquense.github.io/react-big-calendar/examples/index.html?path=/story/about-big-calendar--page) in September 2023, it has become the preferred choice for our users. This open-source React library offers powerful features like:

- Seamless switching between **month, week, and day views**.
- Quick navigation to the **current day** with a single click.
- Display of events across **previous and subsequent time ranges**.
- A polished, professional design.

Due to overwhelming user preference, we’ve decided to retire the Legacy Calendar mode. Starting with version 3.0.0, **Big Calendar is the only mode available**, ensuring a consistent and modern experience for all users.

## Expanded Date Format Options

We’ve listened to your feedback and expanded the date format options in Business Calendar 3.0.0. In addition to existing formats tied to the user’s language settings, we’ve added **English 24-hour** and **ISO 8601** formats. You can now override the default language-based formatting for greater flexibility.

## Grafana 10 and 11 Compatibility

:::warning Breaking Changes
Grafana 9 is no longer supported in Business Calendar 3.0.0. This release is
compatible with Grafana 10 and the upcoming Grafana 11.
:::

To stay aligned with the latest advancements in Grafana, Business Calendar 3.0.0 fully supports **Grafana 10** and is prepared for **Grafana 11**. Unfortunately, this means we’ve had to discontinue support for Grafana 9. We encourage users to upgrade to a supported version to take advantage of the latest features and improvements.
