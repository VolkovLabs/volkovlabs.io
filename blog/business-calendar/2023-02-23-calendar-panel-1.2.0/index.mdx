## Modernized Styles with Theme v2

Weâ€™ve upgraded from Theme v1 to v2, revamping the pluginâ€™s appearance for a polished, user-friendly experience. The new **Display Time** option lets you view event times before titles, enhancing readability.

## Dynamic Event Coloring

One of the most requested features is here! Color events dynamically based on configured threshold ranges to highlight critical data at a glance.

## Enhanced Event Details

When events overflow a day cell, a **"N more"** link appears. Click it to view the full list in a sidebar. You can also click individual events to see detailed information or follow data links if the **On Click** option is set to **Open Link**.
