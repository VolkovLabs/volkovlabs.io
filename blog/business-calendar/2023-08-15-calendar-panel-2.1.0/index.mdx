## Legacy Calendar: Still an Option

For those who prefer the original experience, the **Legacy Calendar** remains available. Built with custom components, it offers a simpler interface with support for multi-month event displays and scrolling. However, it lacks the advanced toolbar and detailed week/day views of Big Calendar.

## Multi-Language Support for Global Users

Both Big Calendar and Legacy Calendar now support multiple languages, aligning with Grafana’s native language options. Display dates and interfaces in:

- Spanish
- French
- German
- Simplified Chinese

Big Calendar also includes a fully localized toolbar for a seamless user experience.

## Enhanced Annotations Management

The Business Calendar panel now offers greater control over annotations in Grafana. Customize your view with these new settings:

- **Filter by Type**: Choose to display alerts only, annotations only, or both.
- **Set Limits**: Define a maximum number of annotations to keep your calendar uncluttered.
