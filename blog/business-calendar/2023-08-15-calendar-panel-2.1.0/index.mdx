## Big Calendar

Big Calendar is a new version of the calendar panel based on a powerful React library.

It adds a multi-language toolbar that allows you to:

1. Switch between month, week, and day views.
2. Switch back to the current day (today).
3. Display events from the previous and subsequent time ranges.

## Legacy calendar

The legacy calendar is a native implementation of the calendar based on custom components. Unlike Big Calendar, it does not provide a toolbar and has limited support for week and day views.

The legacy calendar allows you to display events from several months and scroll through them.

The legacy calendar and Big Calendar support dates in four native Grafana languages: Spanish, French, German, and simplified Chinese. Big Calendar also provides a multi-language toolbar.

## Annotations

The Business Calendar panel plugin allows you to display and filter annotations in Grafana.

In the plugin settings, you can do the following:

- Select what to display: both alerts and annotations, alerts only, or annotations only.
- Set the maximum limit of returned annotations.
