## Event details configuration

The **Event details** is an overlay window containing all event details.

/>

You can configure which elements will be a part of the event details in the **Events**->**Details info** option.

  width="50%"
/>

The Event details window could appear:

- after a mouse click if the **On click** is set to **Show details**,

/>
- when a mouse hovers if the **Tooltip** is set to **Enabled** (new in this plugin
release).

## Multiple fields in the description

You can specify multiple fields to be displayed in the event description.

/>

## The Description format option

You might want to apply formatting for better visual display when your event descriptions contain comprehensive details.

Your options for the description formatting are:

- **Inline**. You can use simple HTML formatting tags to have different font sizes, colors, etc.
- **Preformatted** is very similar to the HTML tag `<pre>`. Text is displayed in a fixed-width font, with spaces and line breaks preserved. The text is displayed "as is".

The illustration below shows how the same description text is interpreted depending on the selected **Description format** option.

## Disable event time for the Month layout

For the **Month** layout, you can turn off the displaying of the event times.

## Text Size configuration

Now, you can control the font size in your Calendar panel.
By default, the size is 12px.

## Portuguese language in Grafana 11

Starting from version 11, Grafana supports the Portuguese language. The Business Calendar follows suit and now also supports it.

## Added Agenda (List) View

The **Agenda** layout displays only busy spots, combining many days at once. You can use the Grafana **Thresholds** to set the background color according to the specified numeric field.
