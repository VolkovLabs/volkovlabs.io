The Event Details window can be triggered in two ways:

- **On Click**: Set **On Click** to **Show Details** to open a side drawer with full event information.
- **On Hover**: Enable the new **Tooltip** feature to display details when hovering over an event.

## Multiple Fields in Event Descriptions

Enhance your event descriptions by including multiple fields. This allows for richer context and better organization of information directly within the calendar view.

## Description Formatting Options

For events with detailed descriptions, formatting is key to readability. Business Calendar 3.5.0 introduces two formatting options:

- **Inline**: Use basic HTML tags for custom styling like font sizes and colors.
- **Preformatted**: Similar to the HTML `<pre>` tag, this preserves spaces and line breaks for a "as-is" display.

## Hide Event Time in Month Layout

Simplify your **Month** layout by disabling the display of event times. This is perfect for calendars where the exact timing isn’t critical.

## Text Size Customization

Take control of your calendar’s readability with the new **Text Size** configuration. The default font size is 12px, but you can adjust it to fit your dashboard’s design.

## Portuguese Language Support in Grafana 11

With Grafana 11 introducing Portuguese language support, Business Calendar 3.5.0 now fully supports it as well, ensuring a localized experience for Portuguese-speaking users.

## Agenda (List) View

The new **Agenda** layout offers a compact, list-based view of your events, ideal for displaying busy periods across multiple days. Pair it with Grafana’s **Thresholds** to apply background colors based on numeric fields for quick visual insights.
