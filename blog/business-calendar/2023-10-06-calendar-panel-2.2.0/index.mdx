## Feature Highlights

### Event Location (Big Calendar Only)

A new **Location** parameter in the Event category lets you specify where an event takes place. It appears next to the event text (separated by a colon) and in the Event Details popup when you click an event.

### Text Contrast (Big Calendar Only)

Ensure your event text is always readable with automatic color adjustments. This feature dynamically contrasts text against background colors for better visibility.

### Work Week and Custom Views (Big Calendar Only)

We’ve added a **Work Week** view to the Calendar category, displaying only Monday to Friday and hiding weekends. Additionally, you can now configure which views (day, week, work week, month) are available to end-users for a personalized experience.
