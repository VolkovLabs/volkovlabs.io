## Favorites

The variable panel allows selecting values as favorites, which are stored in the Web browser's storage and are unique for each user.

The new favorite icon in the header allows you to filter all selected favorites for quick navigation and selection.

## Tree View groups

Multiple tree view groups allow selecting variables based on location, configuration, manufacturer, etc.

Each group has its level configuration and is based on the data from the data frames. Levels from the data frame should have the same name as the variable.

An additional option to display the variable name in front of the value can be enabled to provide additional context for the users.

## Test Coverage

For developing our plugins we use continuous integration with 80+% test coverage to make sure that any changes won't break existing functionality. We talked about it in [our developing panel plugins series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga5Ik32vqIw).

The Variable panel builds on top of the regular dashboard variables. It allows you to have dashboard filters in a separate panel which you can place anywhere on the dashboard.

The variable panel offers you single- and multi-variable layouts along with an advanced Tree View.
