## Grafana Plugin Tools

:::info Improvements
Grafana Team did some improvements in the tools and added deprecated messaging to the Grafana Toolkit.

We will migrate our plugins to Grafana tools for Grafana 10 release.
:::

Grafana recently released `@grafana/create-plugin@1.0.0`, which will eventually replace the plugin development parts of `@grafana/toolkit`. There is no timeline for when it happens.

Plugin Tools are supposed to be

- Easy to Use.
- Focus on What Matters.
- Provides Transparency.

We created a new plugin and migrated the existing one using Plugin Tools. I don't see any reason to migrate from the toolkit yet considering

- Project is not well maintained with legacy issues still open.
- Project has separate [documentation](https://grafana.github.io/plugin-tools/) from the Grafana docs.
- Released version is based on an older version of libraries when the toolkit is built on 9.3.6.

Until we have a clear direction, we will continue using the toolkit in our templates.

## GitHub Actions

In our Continuous Integration (CI) and Release GitHub Actions we used `Is Compatible` and custom `plugin-validator` steps, which were removed.

Both of them we consider as works in progress and use on-demand when required.

- `Is Compatible` GitHub Action is outdated based on Node 12 and set-output commands, which will stop working soon. The open issue to migrate has not been fixed since October.
- Plugin Validator requires setup of Golang environment and we have not seen any valuable feedback from it using our templates.

## Getting Started

We created many Grafana panels, data sources and applications to this moment. To make the creation process efficient, starting with a well-constructed template is always easier.
