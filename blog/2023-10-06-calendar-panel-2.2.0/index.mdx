## Event Location

In the Event section, a new <b>Location</b> parameter is available for Big Calendar type only.

It is displayed in two places. First is following the <b>Text</b>, separated by a colon character(:). The second is in the Event Details, a popup window appearing after you click on the event in the calendar panel.

## Contrast Text

This feature ensures that a text color always contrasts well with the background color. It is available for Big Calendar type only.

## Work Week and select views

In the Calendar section, for the Views parameter, we added a new option <b>work week</b>. The setting is similar to a week view, but instead of seven days, it displays 5 days and hides Saturdays and Sundays.

In addition, now you can configure which views out of four (day, week, month, work week) will be available for an end-user.

The feature is available for Big Calendar type only.

## Dashboard time zones

Starting from this release, the Business Calendar panel supports dashboard time zones. Previously, it synched with the Browser time zone.
