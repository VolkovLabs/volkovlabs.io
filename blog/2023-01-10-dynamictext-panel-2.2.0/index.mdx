## JavaScript Code

Community asked - we delivered JavaScript Code Editor to add Handlebars helpers and Event handlers. Take a look at the [documentation](/plugins/volkovlabs-dynamictext-panel/code) for examples.

### Define Custom Handlebars helper

A custom handlebars helper can be added to replace the field's value using a pattern.

```handlebars
{{replace Test "Pattern" "Replaced"}}
```

JavaScript Code:

```js
handlebars.registerHelper("replace", (context, pattern, replacement) =>
  context.replace(pattern, replacement)
);
```

### Add Internationalization

Grafana 9 added Internationalization, which is not provided to plugins yet. Meanwhile, we can use the `getLocale()` method to get a value for the selected locale and show messages from a defined dictionary.

Content:

```handlebars
{{translate "Hello"}}
```

Default Content:

```handlebars
{{translate "Default"}}
```

JavaScript Code:

<Code
  url="https://github.com/VolkovLabs/volkovlabs.io/blob/main/docs/volkovlabs-dynamictext-panel/translate.js"
  language="js"
/>

## Getting Started

The Dynamic Text visualization panel can be installed from the [Grafana Catalog](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/marcusolsson-dynamictext-panel/) or utilizing the Grafana command line tool.

For the latter, please use the following command.

```bash
grafana-cli plugins install marcusolsson-dynamictext-panel
```

## YouTube Tutorial

A Dynamic Text visualization panel is a Grafana plugin that transforms monotone text/table data into vibrant, easy-to-read information cards. The panel supports variables, Markdown and Handlebars.

The Dynamic Text visualization panel lets you define a text template using the data from your data source query.
