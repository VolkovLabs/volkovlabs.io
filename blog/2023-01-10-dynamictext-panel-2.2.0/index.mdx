# Dynamic Text Panel 2.2.0

We're excited to announce the release of Dynamic Text Panel 2.2.0. This feature release includes the following:

- Added the JavaScript code editor supporting Handlebars helpers and event handlers.
- Completed the refactoring of internal components.
- Migrated styles to Grafana Theme v2.
- Added support for the `{{json @root}}` and `{{split String ','}}` helpers.
- Updated CSS styles to fit images to the screen.
- Added support for internationalization using custom helpers.

## JavaScript code editor

We analyze requests from our community with a passion and appreciate the feedback. This time, we added support for Handlebars helpers and event handlers that you can add in the JavaScript code editor. For examples, please see our [documentation](/plugins/volkovlabs-dynamictext-panel/code).

### Define custom Handlebars helpers

You can add a custom Handlebars helper to replace the field's value according to some pattern.

```handlebars
{{replace Test "Pattern" "Replaced"}}
```

JavaScript Code:

```js
handlebars.registerHelper("replace", (context, pattern, replacement) =>
  context.replace(pattern, replacement)
);
```

### Add Internationalization

Grafana 9 offers internationalization, which plugins do not yet have full access to. Meanwhile, you can use the `getLocale()` method to get a value for the chosen locale and display terms from a defined dictionary.

Content:

```handlebars
{{translate "Hello"}}
```

Default Content:

```handlebars
{{translate "Default"}}
```

JavaScript code:

<Code
  url="https://github.com/VolkovLabs/volkovlabs.io/blob/main/docs/volkovlabs-dynamictext-panel/js/translate.js"
  language="js"
/>

## Getting Started

You can install Dynamic Text Panel from the [Grafana Plugins catalog](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/marcusolsson-dynamictext-panel/) or using the Grafana command line tool.

For the latter, please use the following command:

```bash
grafana-cli plugins install marcusolsson-dynamictext-panel
```

## YouTube Tutorial

Dynamic Text Panel is a Grafana visualization plugin that converts plain text and table data into visually appealing, easy-to-read information cards. You can use variables, Markdown, and Handlebars to customize the look of the outputted cards.

The Dynamic Text Panel plugin allows you to construct a text visualization template from the values of a dataset returned by a data source query.
