# Apache ECharts Panel 4.2.0

We are happy to announce the release of Apache ECharts Panel 4.2.0. This release includes the following updates:

- Added the `EventBus` parameter to publish events.
- Removed the panel padding, allowing you to use all of the panel space from corner to corner.
- Updated the default background to `transparent` for light and dark themes.
- Updated the plugin to the latest Grafana 9.4.3 toolkit and workflows.

:::info Grafana Plugins catalog
The plugin was updated in the Grafana Plugins catalog on March 8, 2023.

## No Padding

The removal of the panel padding lets you use the panel space more effectively for displaying charts, maps, and graphics across the entire width and height of the panel.

## Community Use cases

We are amazed by the everyday developments of the community that make use of the latest capabilities in Apache ECharts Panel for Grafana.

### Dynamic toolbox

Our community member [ftasso](https://github.com/ftasso) shared an extremely interesting use case that displays complex ECharts objects like a sunburst with the toolbox. It dynamically retrieves data and uses a variety of variables for chart generation.

<Code

  language="js"
/>

### Preserve the selected range on a visual map

Our community member [Barryetter](https://github.com/Barryetter) shared another use case that allows you to preserve the range slider settings of the `visualMap` object after the dashboard refresh.

1. Specify two dashboard variables. Constants are also fine but you need to hide them from the user. Name them `datarangeStart` and `datarangeEnd` and apply some initial values to them.
2. In the Apache EChart Panel code editor (before the `return` snippet), add an event handler for the `datarangeselected` event. Remove any other event handler to prevent creation of duplicate handlers.

<Code
  url="https://github.com/VolkovLabs/volkovlabs.io/blob/main/blog/2023-03-04-echarts-panel-4.2.0/range.js"
  language="js"
/>

3. In the `visualMap` definition, set the `range` property to the dashboard variables using the `replaceVariables` method as described in our [documentation](/plugins/volkovlabs-echarts-panel/variables).

<Code
  url="https://github.com/VolkovLabs/volkovlabs.io/blob/main/blog/2023-03-04-echarts-panel-4.2.0/visual-map.js"
  language="js"
/>

## Create DOM (Document Object Model) Elements

You can add elements (buttons, checkboxes, dropdown boxes, etc.) to the DOM (Document Object Model) using `echartsInstance` contributed by [Lroy](https://github.com/Lroy).

For example, you can add a button with an event handler.

<Code
  url="https://github.com/VolkovLabs/volkovlabs.io/blob/main/blog/2023-03-04-echarts-panel-4.2.0/dom.js"
  language="js"
/>
