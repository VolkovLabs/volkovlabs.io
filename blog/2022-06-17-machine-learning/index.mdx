# Using Grafana and machine learning for real-time microscopy image analysis

On June 15, 2022, Mikhail Volkov from Volkov Labs and Christopher Field from [Theia Scientific](https://www.theiascientific.com/) headlined their innovative session on the second day of GrafanaCONline 2022.

A month ago, we published the article [How Theia Scientific and Volkov Labs used Grafana and AI to analyze scientific images](https://grafana.com/blog/2022/04/29/how-theia-scientific-and-volkov-labs-use-grafana-and-ai-to-analyze-scientific-images/) on Grafana Blog and were thrilled to showcase our work at GrafanaCONline 2022.

## GrafanaCONline

For Mikhail, it was his third time presenting in front of the Grafana community, talking about his projects going beyond Observability by using Grafana as a platform to build modern applications.

> "Theia's production team demonstrated the deployment of machine learning (ML) models on an edge computing device for real-time microscopy image analysis, using Balena for remote device management and Grafana for application control and visualization.
>
> Custom panel plugins and dashboards packaged as a Grafana application are combined with a container-based, multi-service architecture to present scientists and engineers using electron microscopes with a coherent and customizable platform for automated image analysis."

With the help of Grafana, the project cut labor costs by 80%, reduced training time and operational expertise needed, and accelerated the delivery of unbiased results from years, months, and days to just seconds.

## Presentation

You can watch the presentation with a live demonstration on Grafana's Youtube channel.

Volkov Labs continues to work closely with Theia Scientific to improve the Theiascope™ platform and has already updated the application to the latest Grafana 9 introduced at GrafanaCONline 2022.
