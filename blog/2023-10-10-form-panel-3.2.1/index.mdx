## Date Time

Now you can impose the allowed minimum and maximum date by using the familiar built-in Grafana controls.

## Field Mapping

Following many community requests, we made field-to-form element mapping for the <b>Data Source</b> and <b>Query</b> initial request type more straightforward. Now you can do it using a new parameter that appears for every form element when the proper initial request type is selected.

### Data Source

### Query

/>

## Show If supports variables

Every form element has the <b>Show If returned value is true</b> parameter where you enter JavaScript code.

- If this code returns `true`, the element is shown on the panel.
- If this code returns `false`, the element is hidden from the panel.

  src="/img/blog/2023-10-10-form-panel-3.2.1/select.png"
/>

Example code to check the current value of the `select` element and show the `dateTime` element if the value equal to `max`:

```js
const select = elements.find((element) => element.id === "select");

if (select) {
  return select.value === "max";
}
```

In this release, we made it possible to use dashboard and global variables within your JavaScript code.

  title="Conditional visibility using a dashboard variable example."
  src="/img/blog/2023-10-10-form-panel-3.2.1/var.png"
/>

Example code to check the value of the dashboard variable `var`:

```
const test = replaceVariables('$var');
return test === 'test'
```

## File Upload

For the File type, you can specify a list of allowed file extensions.

  src="/img/blog/2023-10-10-form-panel-3.2.1/accepted.png"
/>

## Indication of loading in progress

If the data loading takes time, the Data Manipulation form will indicate that as follows.

### Initial Request

The end user will see a running blue line at the top of the form.

/>

### Update Request

All buttons are disabled and moving circled dots are placed instead of the Submit button icon.

  src="/img/blog/2023-10-10-form-panel-3.2.1/status-update.png"
/>

### Custom Code

Custom code can be asynchronous. For that, the custom code should return the promise.

```
const getInitialData = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('http://123');

  const data = await response.json();

  /**
   * Update Elements with data
   */
  onChange([])
}

/**
 * Return Promise
 */
return getInitialData()
```

## Radio and Select icons

Radio with Custom options element and two Select elements (Select with custom options and Multi Select with Custom options) have the <b>Options</b> parameter where you specify all possible choices that a user can make.

Starting from this release, every such choice in addition to type, value and label, now has an icon parameter. You can select from the standard Grafana icon list.
