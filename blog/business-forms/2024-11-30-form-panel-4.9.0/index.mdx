## Functionality to create sections dynamically

The Business Forms can be created dynamically following the code-specified configuration. That functionality has been available for quite awhile. 

A good example of a Business Form created dynamically, can be found in the following blog post. 

<BlogPost id="form-panel-server-based-elements-20240428" />

Starting from release 4.9.0, in addition to simple forms, you can create [sections](/plugins/business-forms/form-elements/#sections) dynamically as well. 

In the example below, the data about the required sections comes from the data source. In this case, we use the [Business Input](/plugins/business-input/) data source to create a basic data frame containing section information, such as ID and name.

Next, the **Sections** and **Form Elements** categories are shown as not configured. 

In the **Initial Request** category, the **Initial Action** is set to **Code**. 

<Image
  title="Create sections dynamically. Example."
  src="/img/blog/2024-11-30-form-panel-4.9.0/dyn-sec-how.png"
/>

The JavaScript from the example above:

```JavaScript
const ids = context.panel.data.series[0].fields[0].values
const names = context.panel.data.series[0].fields[1].values

const sections = ids.map((item, index) => ({
  id: item,
  name: names[index]
}))

context.panel.sectionsUtils.add({ name: sections[0].name, id: sections[0].id, elements: [] })
context.panel.sectionsUtils.add({ name: sections[1].name, id: sections[1].id, elements: [] })
context.panel.sectionsUtils.add({ name: sections[2].name, id: sections[2].id, elements: [] })

```

## Added HTML, Markdown languages to faciliate better formatting in the **Code Editor**

We added two new choices into the **Language** parameter of the **Code Editor** form element type. They are **HTML** and **Markdown**.

## Date form element type

In addition to the existing **Date and time** form element type, we added the **Date** type.

  src="/img/blog/2024-11-30-form-panel-4.9.0/date-type.png"
/>

## Added custom input for **Select** and **Multi select** form element types

If allowed, users can enter custom values into the **Select** and **Multi select** form element types

/>

## Sections, labels and button titles support variables

You can use dashboard variables in the:
 - Section names,
 - Form elements labels, 
 - All three buttons (**Submit**, **Reset**, **Save Default Button**) texts.

  src="/img/blog/2024-11-30-form-panel-4.9.0/var-sections-labels-buttons.png"
/>

## Improved Autosize Code Editor

The Autosize Code Editor opens in a new window after a user clicks on the four-direction button.

<Image
  title="Expand the code area button."
  src="/img/blog/2024-08-26-dynamictext-panel-5.3.0/button.png"
  width="20%"
/>

You can find this button at the top left corner of the **Code** parameter.

  title="Use the expand code area button to open your code in a separate window."
  src="/img/blog/2024-08-29-form-panel-4.4.0/window.png"
/>

To improve the user experience further, we added the following four buttons:

- **Copy code**. Copies the highlighted code in the memory buffer.
- **Paste code**. Pastes the content of the memory buffer.
- **Wrap code on new lines**. Fits the text into the visible area on the screen.
- **Show/Hide mini map**. Shows/hides the far right area depicting the code at scale.

## Compatibility with Grafana 11.3 and Scenes powered dashboards

The [Scenes powered dashboards in Grafana 11.3 release](https://grafana.com/blog/2024/10/31/grafana-dashboards-are-now-powered-by-scenes-big-changes-same-ui/) introduced some breaking changes for our plugins.

Starting from release 4.9.0, the Business Forms panel fully migrated to support Grafana 11.3.
