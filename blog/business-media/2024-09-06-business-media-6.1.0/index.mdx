## Clarified media type and source parameters

Starting from this release, you can clearly specify the media type and the data frame column name for the Business Media panel.

You can add as many different media files on the same as needed.

### PDF media type. Breaking change

:::warning breaking change
Starting from this release, you must specify PDF media type. If the media type is not specified for PDF file(s), the Business Media panel might NOT display it correctly.
:::

<Image

## Loading media files from URL

The media files can be loaded from the URL link which makes video streaming as accessible as ever. To try it out, simply copy the link of a video, specify media type and field name in the **Media Sources** parameter.

URL video link from the example below:

```link
https://archive.org/download/BigBuckBunny_124/Content/big_buck_bunny_720p_surround.mp4
```

## Refactored image links. **Breaking change**

:::warning breaking change
Following Grafana 11 new features, we removed previously existing image links and allowed using a new **Data links** feature instead. Be sure to update your Business Media panel options accordingly.
:::

The links can open in the same tab or a new tab.

## Added a poster feature for the video media type

You can specify a poster image (thumbnail) file for your video files. Use the **Video/Audio**->**Poster Image** parameter for that. A poster image is an image that is shown before the user clicks on the play button (unless the **Auto play** is enabled).

The image can be in the base64 format or a link to the external web resource.

## Original size with scroll for images

To allow more displaying options, we added **Original with scroll** to both **Width** and **Height** parameters.

<Image

You can allow scrolling only horizontally, vertically, or simultaneously in both directions.
