- Added a toolbar to download, zoom in/out, and navigate between images.

## Image Toolbar

The new toolbar allows you to download, zoom, and navigate between multiple images retrieved from your data source.

The toolbar is enabled by default in the panel options, but you need to define what action buttons to display. The toolbar remains hidden until buttons are selected.
