# Display Base64 images from any data source

The Business Media panel plugin has recently been upgraded in the [Grafana Plugins catalog](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/volkovlabs-image-panel/) and now has everything you need to display images from any data source on your dashboards.

The initial version of the Grafana plugin was designed for the project analyzing a camera feed in real-time and simplified the original project by displaying AI-analyzed images on the Grafana dashboard.

In the latest version of Grafana 8.1, you can install standalone plugins from the Grafana Plugins catalog.

## Panel Features

The values returned from the data source can be Base64 encoded with or without definition in the format like `data:image/jpg;base64,ENCODED-CONTENT` or `data:application/pdf;base64,ENCODED-CONTENT`.

If no definition is provided, the file type is automatically determined based on the first Base64 symbol.

If the data source returns more than one field of the `string` type, you can choose the field name in the plugin's options. If the data source returns multiple rows, the image from the last row is displayed in the panel.

The image's dimensions can be automatically adjusted, left as-is, or changed based on the values you specify in the panel settings.
