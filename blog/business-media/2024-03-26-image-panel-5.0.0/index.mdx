## Business Media

The Base64 Media panel joins the [Business Suite](/plugins/) for Grafana and with that gets an elevated name. Now, the same amazing open source plugin is called the Business Calendar panel.

Please welcome the new name for the same functionality!

## Grafana 10 and Grafana 11

:::warning
This is a breaking change.
:::

Our plugins always follow the latest Grafana versions and stay compatible with the most recent releases. That means, however, that we have to sunset the support of obsolete releases.

The latest Base64 5.0.0 fully supports Grafana 10 and the upcoming 11 releases.

## Customize the No Results message

We added a new option where you can specify a message to display instead of the image in case of loading problems or no data error. By default, the message says "Nothing to display..."

## Infinity play option

This new option allows you to play video and audio files in an endless loop.

## File Upload video

Below is one of our YouTube videos with a use-case review. It features three open source plugins that come together on one Grafana dashboard to provide a solution for a long-standing task - file upload using a Grafana dashboard and immediate display of the uploaded files.

The plugins used in the example are:

- [The Business Forms panel](/plugins/business-forms/) to provide with the File type element for file upload.
- [The Business Forms panel](/plugins/business-forms/) to provide with the File type element for file upload.
- [The Business Variable panel](/plugins/business-variable/) to provide a choice of what file to display.
- [The Business Media panel](/plugins/business-media/) to display a selected file.

The Base64 plugin is an essential element in this example.
