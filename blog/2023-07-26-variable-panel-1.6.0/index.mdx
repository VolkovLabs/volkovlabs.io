## Minimized mode

The minimized mode is similar to the native select and works for Query and Custom variables.

Depending on the variable options user allow to select a single or multi-value in the multi-lines element.

The variable panel allows updating dashboard variables without occupying valuable top space and placing it anywhere on the dashboard.

## Input text box

We added a community-requested feature allowing input value for the Text box variables.

The input text box is supported in the table and minimized display modes. If you select the table and enable the feature, the input can be sticky and follow used when scrolling the dashboard.
