# Closed for Business: Volkov Labs Freezes Business Suite for Grafana and Ends Support After Acquisition

It is with mixed emotions that we announce a significant change for Volkov Labs and our cherished Business Suite for Grafana. After four remarkable years of innovation, collaboration, and over 40 million downloads, Volkov Labs has been acquired by Enerview.AI. As a result, we are freezing development of the Business Suite for Grafana and discontinuing support for these plugins, effective immediately.

## A Legacy of Innovation

Founded in 2021 in Tampa, Florida, Volkov Labs set out to transform Grafana into a leading platform for business intelligence. Our Business Suite—comprising 9 open-source plugins, including Business Charts, Business Media, and Business Forms—revolutionized how teams interact with data, turning dashboards into dynamic, intuitive applications.

From pioneering AI-driven image recognition to powering Golden Grot Award-winning dashboards at GrafanaCON, your unwavering support has been the cornerstone of our growth. Together, we’ve built tools that empowered countless organizations to visualize and act on their data like never before.

## What This Means for Our Community

We understand that this news may raise questions about the future of your projects. Here’s what you need to know:

- **Development Freeze**: We will no longer release new features, updates, or compatibility patches for the Business Suite plugins.
- **End of Support**: As of September 26, 2025, technical support, bug fixes, and community assistance for the Business Suite will cease across all channels, including GitHub and YouTube.
- **Open-Source Availability**: The Business Suite repositories will remain accessible on GitHub under their current licenses. We encourage users to fork or archive the code as needed, as no further maintenance will be provided.

## A Heartfelt Thank You

To our incredible community—thank you. Your feedback, GitHub contributions, and inspiring dashboard creations have shaped the Business Suite into a tool that touched millions of users worldwide.
