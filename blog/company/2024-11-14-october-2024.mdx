## Grafana 11.3

The recent [Grafana 11.3 release](https://grafana.com/blog/2024/10/31/grafana-dashboards-are-now-powered-by-scenes-big-changes-same-ui/) introduced Scenes-powered dashboards, which brought some breaking changes for our plugins. We’re grateful to the Grafana Engineering team for their swift collaboration in resolving these issues. A special shout-out to Ivan Ortega for his support on [GitHub issue #93327](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/pull/93327).

Following the initial fix, we implemented [additional updates](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/94479) to ensure seamless compatibility with Grafana 11.3, maintaining the exceptional user experience our community expects.

To date, six Volkov Labs plugins have been updated to support Grafana 11.3. The remaining plugins will follow according to their individual release schedules and pending issues.
