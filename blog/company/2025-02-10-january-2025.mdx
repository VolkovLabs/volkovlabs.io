## Recalibrating Our Development Focus

Our widely adopted open-source [Business Suite plugin collection](/plugins/) has consistently met user needs, delivering robust features and earning the trust of a delighted user base. However, having covered most user requirements, we felt it was time to explore new challenges.

While we will continue to maintain and enhance the Business Suite plugin collection—adding highly requested features and ensuring compatibility with future Grafana versions—our primary focus for 2025 is an exciting new venture: the [Business Intelligence platform](/big/) for Grafana.

Through close collaboration with the Grafana community and addressing real-world production use cases, we’ve identified a strong demand for reimagined alerting and reporting functionalities. Users frequently requested simplified interactions with all controls in a unified interface, as well as advanced features like anomaly detection for self-hosted Grafana instances.

### Platform Architecture

The concept of the Business Intelligence platform emerged from extensive brainstorming and invaluable community feedback. We’ve designed a scalable, user-friendly system that can evolve in multiple directions while remaining easy to manage.

This architecture empowers users to:

- Manage multiple Grafana instances from a centralized [Business Studio](/big/studio/).
- Benefit from an intuitive, streamlined interface.
- Seamlessly integrate with upcoming Business Engine features.

Additionally, it opens possibilities for version control across Grafana instances, streamlined dashboard propagation (e.g., from DEV to QA to production), and more.

## Release Highlights

Aligning with our new priorities, we’ve rolled out three consecutive releases of the Business Intelligence platform, each introducing significant improvements and enhancements.

### Business Intelligence 2.2.0
