# Volkov Labs at GrafanaCON 2024: A Celebration of Community and Innovation

At Volkov Labs, Grafana is more than a tool—it's a passion. Nothing captures this spirit better than the in-person conferences Grafana hosts globally. This spring, we had the honor of attending **GrafanaCON 2024** in the dynamic city of Amsterdam, Netherlands.

Over two incredible days, we engaged in meaningful collaborations, connected with inspiring individuals, and savored exceptional food.

Our mission was to immerse ourselves in Grafana’s culture, uncover their strategic priorities, and gain insights into future developments. What we didn’t anticipate was the overwhelming appreciation from attendees. As we wandered the conference halls, lemonade in hand, countless people approached us with gratitude: _"Thank you for your plugins; they’ve been a lifesaver for my company!"_ These heartfelt interactions made the journey truly unforgettable.

While download statistics for our plugins are impressive, meeting users in person and hearing their stories provided invaluable perspective.

## Golden Grot Award Winner: Professional Category

For nearly three years, we’ve partnered with [Theia Scientific](https://www.theiascientific.com) and [Chris Fields](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisrfield/) on a transformative project. This initiative enables nuclear scientists across the US to analyze material quality under microscopes with unprecedented speed and accuracy.

We’re ecstatic to share that the dashboard we co-developed clinched the prestigious **Golden Grot Award** in the Professional category at GrafanaCON 2024. With only two winners each year—one personal and one professional—this accolade is a remarkable honor.

## JAXA Moon Landing: Monitoring with Volkov Labs Plugins

A standout moment at GrafanaCON 2024 occurred during a keynote follow-up session. [Satoshi Nakahira](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nakahira-isas/), Associate Senior Researcher at [JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency)](https://global.jaxa.jp), showcased their historic [Moon landing project](https://global.jaxa.jp/press/2024/01/20240125-1_e.html). As I viewed the [dashboards used for probe monitoring](https://twitter.com/SLIM_JAXA/status/1747484502962893087), I was thrilled to spot our **[Business Media panel](/plugins/business-media/)** prominently displayed, tracking probe movements in real time.

## Planted: Innovating with Grafana Beyond Monitoring

Following a delightful lunch and an insightful session on Grafana 11, [Mathias Pawlowsky](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathias-pawlowsky/), Head of Data Science at [Planted](https://ch.eatplanted.com), demonstrated how they harness Grafana for operational excellence. We were excited to see their use of Volkov Labs plugins, including **[Business Forms](/plugins/business-forms/)**, **[Business Variable](/plugins/business-variable/)**, and **[Business Charts](/plugins/business-charts/)**, to enable seamless control directly from Grafana dashboards.

Mathias reinforced a core belief at Volkov Labs: Grafana can extend beyond traditional process monitoring to serve as a central hub for broader business solutions.

## Heineken: Scaling with Grafana Across 85 Breweries

Another highlight was a presentation by [Dolf Noordman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dolf-noordman/) and [Frank Van Boven](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fvanboven/), IIoT and Mission Critical Engineers at [Schuberg Philis](https://schubergphilis.com/en). They revealed an ambitious project connecting 85 Heineken breweries worldwide, monitored via over 4,000 Grafana dashboards.

To handle this scale, they deploy customizable Grafana Docker containers for each client, preloaded with essential plugins—including our **[Business Charts powered by Apache ECharts](/plugins/business-charts/)**. This approach mirrors our own strategies for commercial projects. Want to dive deeper?

## Obirdability: A Charming Bird Monitoring Project

One of the most delightful talks came from [Ivana Huckova](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivana-huckova/) and [Sven Großmann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sven-großmann-26387311b/), Senior Software Engineers at Grafana Labs. Their **Obirdability** project, focused on bird monitoring, was both innovative and endearing. They creatively used our **[Business Text panel](/plugins/business-text/)** to display bird images and play audio clips of bird calls.

## Reflections on the Flight Home

[GrafanaCON 2024](https://grafana.com/about/events/grafanacon/2024/) was an unequivocal success. We achieved every objective, from networking to learning, while immersing ourselves in a vibrant atmosphere and enjoying delicious cuisine.

As we flew home, we were brimming with inspiration and energy. Our team is already ideating new features, plugins, and innovations. GrafanaCON masterfully blended technology with human connection, reinforcing why we’re so passionate about this community—a group of tech enthusiasts who prioritize simplicity, maintainability, and speed in their solutions.
