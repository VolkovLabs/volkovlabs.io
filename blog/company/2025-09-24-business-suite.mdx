# 4 Years of Innovations at Volkov Labs: Transforming Grafana with the Business Suite Plugins

As I reflect on the past four years at Volkov Labs, it's hard not to feel a surge of pride and excitement. Founded in 2021 in the heart of Tampa, Florida, our journey began with a simple yet ambitious vision: to bridge the gap between Grafana's powerful observability capabilities and the everyday needs of business users.

What started as a small team tinkering with data visualization has evolved into a thriving open-source ecosystem, with over 40 million downloads across our plugins and a passionate community driving us forward. At the core of this evolution is our flagship **[Business Suite for Grafana](/plugins/)**—a curated collection of 9 open-source plugins that turn Grafana dashboards into full-fledged, interactive web applications.

Today, on the cusp of our fifth year, let's take a walk down memory lane. From humble beginnings with AI-driven image recognition to award-winning dashboards at GrafanaCON, here's how the Business Suite has redefined business intelligence in Grafana over the last four years.

## The Spark: Entering the Grafana Community (2021)

Our story with the Business Suite truly ignited four years ago, when we dove headfirst into the Grafana ecosystem. It all started with a unique challenge: building an AI image recognition project to count cars on a busy highway in real-time. To visualize Base64-encoded images directly on Grafana dashboards, we created the [Business Media Panel](/plugins/business-media/)—our first foray into multimedia integration.

This plugin wasn't just a technical workaround; it was an innovation that blended observability with dynamic visuals, supporting formats like PNG, JPG, GIF, MP4, and even PDFs.

/>

Inspired by this success, we quickly expanded. The [Business News Data Source](/plugins/business-news/) followed, pulling in RSS and Atom feeds to keep dashboards alive with real-time updates from web resources. With nearly 800,000 downloads, it proved that Grafana could be more than metrics—it could be a newsroom for your data. By the end of 2021, we'd laid the groundwork for what would become the Suite: plugins that prioritize usability, compatibility, and business relevance.

## Accelerating Growth: Compatibility and Core Features (2022)

2022 was a year of rapid iteration and community embrace. As Grafana 9 launched at GrafanaCONline in June, we were ready—testing our plugins against beta versions weeks in advance. The [Business Charts Panel](/plugins/business-charts/), powered by Apache ECharts, got a major upgrade to version 5.3.3, introducing the Monaco Code Editor and support for SVG and Canvas rendering. Suddenly, users could craft dynamic, interactive graphs that rivaled dedicated charting tools.

We also introduced the [Business Input Data Source](/plugins/business-input/), initially for manual data frame testing but quickly evolving into a powerhouse for JavaScript-based emulation and AI integration via Grafana's LLM App (think OpenAI-driven data generation). This plugin exemplified our philosophy: start simple, iterate based on feedback. Our GitHub repos buzzed with activity, and downloads surged as businesses discovered how these tools simplified dashboard creation.

| Year | Key Milestones                               | Downloads Milestone  |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 2021 | Founded; Initial plugins like Business Media | ~1M (early adopters) |
| 2022 | Grafana 9 compatibility; ECharts upgrades    | 10M+ cumulative      |

## Building the Suite: Open-Source Expansion (2023)

By 2023, the Business Suite was no longer a collection of disparate tools—it was a cohesive family. We open-sourced more plugins, renaming and refining them for clarity and power. The [Business Calendar Panel](/plugins/business-calendar/) hit 3 million downloads, enabling seamless event visualization with support for Grafana variables. Meanwhile, the [Business Text Panel](/plugins/business-text/) transformed from a basic dynamic text tool into a "Swiss Army knife," incorporating custom JavaScript, external libraries, and innovative visualizations—all driven by user requests.

Community feedback was our north star. Features like header parameters, password inputs, and subscription to refresh events in [Business Forms](/plugins/business-forms/) made data entry intuitive and secure. We released detailed tutorials, code snippets, and YouTube crash courses, demystifying how to synchronize variables, manipulate data via APIs, and leverage Grafana transformations.

The Suite's total downloads crossed 24 million, a testament to its role in turning Grafana into an enterprise-grade app builder.

## Maturing as Leaders: Recognition and Refinement (2024)

2024 marked our ascent as Grafana influencers. Plugins like [Business Variable](/plugins/business-variable/) and [Business Links](/plugins/business-links/) enhanced dashboard navigation with movable filter panels and dynamic dropdowns, streamlining workflows for teams. We unveiled [Business Table](/plugins/business-table/) as the Suite's tenth plugin, offering intuitive layouts for data presentation—perfect for business reports without the fluff.

At [GrafanaCON 2024, our plugins powered Golden Grot Award winners](/blog/grafanacon-2024), showcasing stunning dashboards that blended observability with business apps.

## Looking Ahead: Grafana Certified and Beyond (2025)

As we step into 2025, Volkov Labs has achieved a landmark: becoming the first Grafana Certified Plugin Partner. Our team grew with fresh talent, and we hit 100 YouTube videos—each one a guide to unlocking the Suite's potential. At [GrafanaCON 2025, our plugins again fueled Golden Grot winners](/blog/golden-grot-2025/).
