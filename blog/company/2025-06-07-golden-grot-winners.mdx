# Golden Grot Awards 2025: Celebrating Winners Powered by Volkov Labs Plugins

GrafanaCON 2025 was a spectacular celebration of innovation, and the Golden Grot Awards once again highlighted the extraordinary talent within the Grafana community. At Volkov Labs, we’re thrilled to see our plugins empower winners for the second year in a row.

From personal passion projects to enterprise-scale solutions, these creators leveraged our tools to turn complex data into visually stunning and highly functional dashboards.

## Unleashing Creativity with Award-Winning Plugins

This year’s Golden Grot Awards winners, Ruben Fernandez and Grant Chase, demonstrated remarkable ingenuity, tackling challenges ranging from scientific research to global space analytics. Our [**Business Text**](/plugins/business-text/) and [**Business Forms**](/plugins/business-forms/) panels, part of the Business Suite, provided the flexibility and power needed to bring their visionary dashboards to life.
