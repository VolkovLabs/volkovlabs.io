## Master Educator Award

We’re thrilled to share that in December, we were honored with the **Master Educator Grafana Champions Award**! This prestigious accolade recognizes our commitment to empowering the Grafana community through high-quality blog posts, tutorials, and video guides.

During the online award ceremony, two key takeaways resonated with us:

- Grafana’s Championship program is a remarkable initiative for fostering community growth.
- Community recognition fuels our passion. We’re more inspired than ever to bring you innovative products, solutions, and tutorials in 2025. Stay tuned!

## Release Dashboard Tutorial

At Volkov Labs, our mission is to equip the Grafana community with practical tools and knowledge. Our YouTube video, ["Create Your Business Grafana Dashboard"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNCKbGfAU0Q), has already inspired over 34,000 viewers, reflecting a strong desire to master Grafana dashboards.

To meet this demand, we’ve released a comprehensive tutorial on configuring our **[Release Dashboard](https://release.volkovlabs.io/)**—a tool we use daily to monitor [Business Suite](/plugins/) plugin development. This dashboard exemplifies Grafana’s flexibility and ease of use.

### Why This Tutorial Stands Out

- **Core Visualizations**: Showcases Grafana’s [Time Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpOazX67GSo) panel in multiple configurations.
- **Custom Plugins**: Highlights [Business Charts](/plugins/business-charts/) and [Business Calendar](/plugins/business-calendar/) for unique data perspectives.
- **User Input**: Features the [Business Forms](/plugins/business-forms/) panel for seamless data entry into a Timescale data source.

## 28 Million Downloads Milestone

We’re overjoyed to announce that downloads for our **Business Suite** plugins are nearing **30 million**! As of November 2024, we’ve reached **28 million**, and we’re optimistic about hitting the next milestone before the year closes.

## Plugin Release News

:::info Compatibility Note
All updated plugins are fully compatible with Grafana 11.3 scenes-powered dashboards.

November 2024 brought **six plugin releases**, with significant enhancements to the fast-evolving [Business Table](/plugins/business-table/) panel. Here’s a roundup of the updates:

### Business Table 1.9.0

Introduced the much-requested [add/delete row feature](/blog/business-table-1.9.0/#ability-to-add-and-delete-a-row), along with new [display column types](/blog/business-table-1.9.0/#new-column-types) and [editable types](/blog/business-table-1.9.0/#new-editor-types). This makes it the second plugin after [Business Forms](/plugins/business-forms/) to enable data transmission back to the source.

/>
<BlogPost id="business-table-1.9.0" />

### Business Charts 6.5.0

The [Visual Editor](/plugins/business-charts/visualeditor) now supports [scatter](/blog/echarts-panel-6.5.0/#scatter) and [boxplot](/blog/echarts-panel-6.5.0/#boxplot) chart types for richer data visualization.

<BlogPost id="echarts-panel-6.5.0" />

### Business Calendar 3.8.0

Improved the **Year Layout** and added panel-specific language and datetime formats to support multi-language dashboards.

<BlogPost id="calendar-panel-3.8.0" />

### Business Forms 4.9.0

Added dynamic section generation, complementing the existing dynamic visual elements for greater flexibility.

## Documentation Revamp

Keeping documentation aligned with fast-evolving plugin features is no small feat. In November, we completely updated the guides for the [Business Table](/plugins/business-table/) panel to streamline the configuration process.

What do you think of the new schema? Does it make configuration easier? We’d love to hear your feedback!
