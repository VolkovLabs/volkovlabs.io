# Business Suite for Grafana: How It All Came Together and Where We’re Headed

The **Business Suite for Grafana** is a powerful collection of open-source plugins designed to transform Grafana into a platform for streamlined business application development. With over **24 million downloads** across all plugins, we’re proud to call it a resounding success.

This suite has earned acclaim from hundreds of users for its ability to go beyond traditional observability, tackling complex business challenges and empowering companies to build cost-effective, in-house applications on tight schedules.

At Volkov Labs, we’re committed to keeping our plugins up-to-date with the latest Grafana versions. You can track our [release schedule and plugin statistics](https://release.volkovlabs.io) on our public project page.

Our focus is on showcasing Grafana’s full potential, providing detailed documentation, and offering step-by-step use cases to demonstrate how building with Grafana can save time and money while delivering tailored functionality.

Whether you’re monitoring system performance or analyzing business data, the Business Suite ensures you get the answers you need—without unnecessary complexity.

- **Business News Data Source**: Visualize RSS and Atom feeds for real-time updates.
- **Business Text Panel**: Create dynamic, data-driven text with custom JavaScript.

## Business Media: Visualizing Real-Time Data

Three years ago, we joined the vibrant Grafana community with a unique challenge: an AI image recognition project to count cars on a busy highway. To visualize Base64-encoded images in real-time on a Grafana dashboard, we created the **Business Media Panel**. Since its debut, it has expanded to support PDFs, videos, and audio files, amassing nearly **3 million downloads** worldwide.

During GrafanaCon in Amsterdam, we were thrilled to learn that the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) used this plugin in their historic [Moon landing project](https://global.jaxa.jp/press/2024/01/20240125-1_e.html) to monitor probe movements in real time.

## Business News: Bringing Updates to Your Dashboard

Inspired by the success of Business Media, we developed the **Business News Data Source** to integrate RSS and Atom feeds into Grafana dashboards. With nearly **800,000 downloads**, this plugin enables users to stay updated with the latest news from various web resources. It’s even referenced in the [Grafana documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/panels-visualizations/visualizations/news/) as an alternative for displaying RSS feeds.

Learn how the [Business News Data Source](/plugins/business-news/) can keep your team informed.

## Business Text: A Swiss Army Knife for Grafana

Originally adopted as the Dynamic Text Panel to enhance news feeds, the **Business Text Panel** has evolved into a mini-development framework within Grafana. With over **7 million downloads**, it’s our most popular plugin. By supporting custom JavaScript and external libraries, it offers unparalleled flexibility—reviving beloved panels like Flowchart and enabling endless customization.

A community member recently shared their enthusiasm in a [forum post](https://community.grafana.com/t/recommendation-business-text-panel-for-javascript-shenanigans/125839):

> _"While it’s designed for custom HTML with Handlebars, it’s also a fantastic place to run JavaScript that interacts with Grafana’s backend. It’s revolutionized how I get extra flexibility from Grafana when the default UI falls short."_

Explore the [Business Text Panel](/plugins/business-text/) and unlock new possibilities for your dashboards.

## Business Satellite: Access Grafana’s Core

The **Business Satellite Data Source**, initially called the HTTP API Data Source, simplifies access to Grafana’s configuration database. It allows you to interact with public Grafana APIs for annotations, dashboards, data sources, alerts, and more, directly from visualization panels.

Unique features include monitoring multiple Grafana instances from a single dashboard. Check out the [Business Satellite Data Source](/plugins/business-satellite/) for seamless integration.

## Business Forms: Interact with Data Directly

Born from a client need in IoT device monitoring, the **Business Forms Panel** allows users to send data back to sources directly from Grafana dashboards. Initially supporting REST API requests, it now includes Data Source and Query options, with a detailed data flow schema to simplify configuration.
