# Celebrate with Us: Our YouTube Channel Turns 1!

It’s been an incredible year since we launched our YouTube channel, and we’re thrilled to reflect on everything we’ve achieved. Starting with zero experience in video content creation, we tapped into our creative side to develop a unique and recognizable format—one that feels like a good friend sharing valuable insights over a cup of coffee.

Our focus has always been on delivering meaningful content. We carefully select topics that resonate with a wide audience and showcase use cases that bring clarity to complex concepts. The overwhelming response from our community has been our guiding light. Your questions have shaped our direction, and your gratitude has fueled our passion. We’re excited to address commonly asked questions that are often hard to find answers to elsewhere.

Through this journey, we’ve built a platform dedicated to spreading technical knowledge and earning a reputation as a trusted resource in the Grafana community. Join us as we celebrate this milestone and look ahead to even more exciting content!

## Our Platform: A Hub for Learning and Inspiration

At Volkov Labs, we’ve created a comprehensive ecosystem of resources to support and inspire our community. Here’s a closer look at the six pillars of our platform:

| Resource                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/@volkovlabs) | As the saying goes, seeing is believing. Our videos bring complex topics to life with clear explanations and practical examples.                                          |
| [Documentation](https://docs.volkovlabs.io)        | We continuously update our documentation to include the latest insights and incorporate community feedback, ensuring it remains a go-to resource.                         |
| [Blog](https://blog.volkovlabs.io)                 | Our blog offers in-depth answers to your questions. We share experiences, code snippets, and step-by-step guidance to help you tackle a variety of challenges.            |
| [GitHub](https://github.com/VolkovLabs)            | Dive into our code, explore innovative ideas, and discover elegant solutions to inspire your own projects.                                                                |
| [Live Dashboard](https://live.volkovlabs.io)       | Initially built for internal use, this project evolved into a public resource. Using Grafana dashboards, we’ve made our digital footprint transparent and easy to follow. |
| [Release Dashboard](https://release.volkovlabs.io) | Stay updated on our open-source Grafana plugins with this dashboard. Track release dates, monitor open issues, and get a clear view of our development progress.          |

### Engaging with Our YouTube Community

We’re always exploring new ways to connect with our followers. For daily updates and quick polls, we’ve found the [YouTube Community](https://youtube.com/@volkovlabs/community) tab to be an invaluable tool.

For instance, a recent post about a new panel idea—designed to provide movable real estate for displaying variables—received significant feedback. This response has encouraged us to prioritize its development and consider creating a dedicated video or article with a compelling use case.

Interestingly, while our focus remains on technical content, many of you have also enjoyed our behind-the-scenes photographs. This unexpected feedback has been a delightful surprise, and we’re happy to share more glimpses of our journey.

After a year of storytelling with Grafana at the heart of our content, we’ve identified three key areas where we excel and aim to grow further:

- **Concepts**: Breaking down complex ideas into digestible insights.
- **Tutorials**: Guiding you step-by-step through practical applications.
- **Use Cases**: Demonstrating real-world solutions you can replicate.

## Concepts: Simplifying the Complex

Before diving into tutorials or detailed guides, we like to take a bird’s-eye view of a topic to understand how all the pieces fit together. This approach often results in clear, insightful diagrams that simplify intricate processes.

These visual aids not only help with initial learning but also serve as excellent refreshers when revisiting a subject after some time. Here are a few examples of our conceptual schemas:

<table>
  <tr style={{ border: "none" }}>
    <td width="50%" style={{ border: "none" }}>

    </td>
    <td width="*" style={{ border: "none" }}>

## Tutorials and Use Cases: Learning by Doing

Tutorials form the backbone of our YouTube channel, consistently attracting the most views and sparking the most questions. We strive to create content that’s relevant to a broad audience, ensuring that anyone—regardless of experience level—can follow along and master the topic.
