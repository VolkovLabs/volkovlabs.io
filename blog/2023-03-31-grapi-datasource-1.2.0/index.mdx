# Grafana HTTP API Data Source 1.2.0

We are happy to announce the release of the Grafana HTTP API Data Source 1.2.0. This release includes the following updates:

- Added formatted Annotation labels for Alerts.

## Alert labels

We added formatted Alert labels in the `labels` field, which can be parsed using `Extract field` transformation to sort, filter, and display by values.

## Alert Rules and UID

Based on the alert rules Annotations will return the Alert name and UID fields. Alert UID can be used for data links to quickly direct to the rules configuration.

## Annotations

Annotations might seem different from the Alerts, but under the hood, they are very similar. With a little help from the Grafana HTTP API data source, you can easily work with both.

This is an introductory video for anyone interested in Grafana Alerts and Annotations.
