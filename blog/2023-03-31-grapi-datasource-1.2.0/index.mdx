## Alert labels

We added formatted Alert labels in the `labels` field, which can be parsed using `Extract field` transformation to sort, filter, and display by values.

## Alert Rules and UID

Based on the alert rules Annotations will return the Alert name and UID fields. Alert UID can be used for data links to quickly direct to the rules configuration.

## Annotations

Annotations might seem different from the Alerts, but under the hood, they are very similar. With a little help from the Business Satellite data source, you can easily work with both.

This is an introductory video for anyone interested in Grafana Alerts and Annotations.
