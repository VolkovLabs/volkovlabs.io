# Variable Panel 2.0.0

We are happy to announce the release of the Variable Panel 2.0.0. This release includes the following updates:

- Added handling of the enter key for the Text Box variable type.
- Added a clear(empty) value for the multi-value variables.
- Added support for the Grafana key-value variable format for all display modes.
- Significant performance improvements.

:::info Grafana Catalog
The plugin was updated in Grafana Catalog on October 18, 2023.

## Enter the key for the Text Box type

Hitting the enter key after typing a text value in the Text box variable type will trigger the dashboard refresh. Before implementing this feature, a user had to use a mouse cursor to click outside the box for the variable to take effect.

## Improved Performance

Up to 10,000 records will work swiftly without significant performance degradation. For up to 50,000 records, you might notice a slight one- to two-second delay. We achieved that improvement by using a table virtualization approach.

The illustration below displays the performance statistics we collected in the Chrome extensions to confirm the approach is working.

## Empty value in Multi-value Variables

This feature works for the following Minimize and Button display modes.

In previous versions, after a user had selected an item in a Multi-value variable, there was no way to unselect all values.

/>

For this feature to work, you must enable the <b>Empty Value</b> parameter in the Variable section.

## Key-values format in Variables

We introduced this feature in version 1.7.0 and it was limited to the Table/Tree View. Starting from this release all display modes (Table/Tree View, Minimize, Button) support the key-value variable format.

A Grafana variable can be composed of a key and value to make it possible to join data sets by IDs(key) while displaying user-friendly names(value).

In the illustration below, screen 1, the `city` variable is created with three key-value pairs.

```text
Chicago:1, New York:2, Tampa:3
```

Screen 2 is a dashboard view where an end-user sees only city names. After the selection is made (here, New York:2), the variable carries a value equal to 2.

From there the `city` variable's value can be used in the queries for other panels, screen 3.

## Getting Started

The Variable panel can be installed from the [Grafana Catalog](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/volkovlabs-variable-panel/) or utilizing the Grafana command line tool.

For the latter, please use the following command.

```bash
grafana-cli plugins install volkovlabs-variable-panel
```

## YouTube Tutorial

The Variable panel builds on top of the regular dashboard variables. It allows you to have dashboard filters in a separate panel which you can place anywhere on the dashboard.

The variable panel offers you single- and multi-variable layouts along with an advanced Tree View.
