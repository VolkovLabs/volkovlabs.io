### LIVE project

If you ever wondered where we take the downloads and other statistics, please check out our [LIVE](http://live.volkovlabs.io) project.
You can find general statistics about all our open-source plugins, including release calendar, download number, and links to all related blog posts and YouTube videos. We created the [LIVE](http://live.volkovlabs.io) project for internal use, but since many people found the presented information useful we made it open to anyone.

If you believe that some other statistical measures would add depth to the overview, contact us and we will consider modifying the existing dashboards.

## Panel syncing for Initial Request

As you know, one of the basic Grafana dashboard parameters is the frequency of updates. In other words, admins/editors can set up how often the whole dashboard is going to be refreshed.

  width="100%"
/>

Some of the time frequencies might bring a challenge for a user trying to populate a Data Manipulation form. If the user does not hit the Submit button often enough then everything they entered is lost. With frequencies less than 3-5 minutes, the task the user faces is practically impossible.

To avoid user stress, we added a new parameter - **Synchronize with data**.

When it is **Disabled**, the Data Manipulation form is excluded from the frequency of update and the user can enter data in peace.

  width="40%"
/>

## Context

**Custom code** allows you to access the panel's options, REST API responses, form elements, and various Grafana services. To keep the Data Manipulation plugin organized and simplify the search among the available options, we allowed to access them all under the **context** object.

Simply type **context** and get the list of everything available from the Data Manipulation arsenal.

/>

### Event Bus and App Events

Starting from this release, we added Event Bus and App Events into the **Context** object. For the complete list, please, reference the [Data Manipulation plugin documentation](/plugins/volkovlabs-form-panel/code).

Refresh all dashboard panels using `EventBus` with global scope called `AppEvents`:

```
context.grafana.appEvents.publish({ type: 'variables-changed', payload: { refreshAll: true } });
```

or

```
context.grafana.refresh();
```

## Variable in Payload functions

Starting from this release we enabled the usage of dashboard variables in the Initial and Update Payloads.
