# State of Documentation

A growing number of maintained plugins for Grafana and an overwhelming number of questions and feature requests from the community forced us to improve our internal processes and consolidate documentation, which was accumulated in various README and GitHub files.

We started this project in December and two months later we are at the point where we can move forward with future developments.

## Blog

A year ago we did not have a website like we do today. We had a Medium blog which was a platform to collect our ideas about Grafana as a platform to build modern applications and plugins we maintain. While working on the documentation we looked at Google Analytics and Search tools we understood that our own documentation and blog posts compete with each other and do not serve the community.

Medium is a great platform and we use it every day to get new knowledge, it provided a great start to share our ideas, but moving forward we decided to move the blog under the same roof with documentation in our own design.
