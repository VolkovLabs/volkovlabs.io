# Exploring Tron Themes in Grafana 12 with Volkov Labs

We’re excited to dive into the vibrant world of Grafana 12’s new experimental themes, with a special spotlight on the **Tron theme**, introduced to celebrate the release of Grafana 12! At Volkov Labs, we’re all about pushing the boundaries of data visualization, and the Tron theme brings a futuristic, neon-charged aesthetic that’s perfect for modern dashboards.

Let’s explore how this theme enhances your Grafana experience and how it integrates with our Business Suite plugins.

## What Are Grafana 12’s Experimental Themes?

Grafana 12 introduces a set of experimental themes to add flair to your dashboards, including **Sapphire Dusk**, **Tron**, **Gilded Grove**, **Gloom**, and **Desert Bloom**. These themes allow users to personalize the Grafana UI, making it more engaging and tailored to specific use cases. The **Tron theme**, inspired by the iconic sci-fi aesthetic, features glowing neon colors and a sleek, high-tech vibe that’s perfect for tech-driven environments.

To try the Tron theme, simply click the user icon in the top-right corner of Grafana, select **Change theme**, and preview the color scheme in the theme drawer. This feature is automatically enabled in Grafana Cloud, but for self-hosted instances, you’ll need to enable the `grafanaconThemes` feature toggle.[](https://grafana.com/whats-new/2025-04-11-introducing-experimental-themes/)

## Why Tron Theme Stands Out

The Tron theme is more than just a visual upgrade—it’s a statement. Its bold neon blues and purples, paired with a dark backdrop, create a striking contrast that enhances readability and draws attention to key metrics. This makes it ideal for:

- **Tech and Gaming Dashboards**: The futuristic aesthetic aligns perfectly with tech-heavy industries or gaming-related data visualizations.
- **Nighttime Monitoring**: The dark, high-contrast design reduces eye strain during long monitoring sessions.
- **Branding Opportunities**: Pair the Tron theme with custom logos and backgrounds for a cohesive, branded experience.

At Volkov Labs, we’ve tested the Tron theme with our Business Suite plugins, including **Business Table**, **Business Charts**, and **Business Calendar**, and the results are stunning. The neon accents highlight interactive elements like charts and event markers, making dashboards both functional and visually captivating.

## Customizing with Tron Theme and Volkov Labs Plugins

To make the most of the Tron theme, combine it with our Business Suite plugins for a seamless, customized experience. Here’s how you can enhance your dashboards.

### Business Table with Tron Theme

The [**Business Table**](/plugins/business-table/) plugin now supports add/delete row features and new display column types, all of which pop vividly under the Tron theme’s neon glow. Configure dynamic tables to display real-time data, with the theme’s high-contrast colors ensuring clarity for nested objects and markdown-supported comments.[](https://volkovlabs.io/blog/gazetta-november-2024/)

### Business Charts with Tron Theme

Our [**Business Charts**](/plugins/business-charts/) plugin integrates Apache ECharts for dynamic visualizations like scatter and boxplot charts. The Tron theme’s vibrant palette enhances these charts, making data trends stand out. For example, a scatter plot tracking system performance metrics will shine with neon highlights, improving both aesthetics and usability.[](https://volkovlabs.io/blog/gazetta-november-2024/)

### Business Calendar with Tron Theme

The [**Business Calendar**](/plugins/business-calendar/) plugin supports multi-language dashboards and yearly views, perfect for event-driven analytics. With the Tron theme, event bubbles and tooltips glow against the dark background, creating an intuitive and immersive experience for tracking schedules or alerts.[](https://volkovlabs.io/plugins/business-calendar/release/)

   - Adjust the application title for a branded experience:
     ```dockerfile
     RUN find /usr/share/grafana/public/build/ -name *.js -exec sed -i 's|"AppTitle","Grafana")|"AppTitle","Tron Analytics")|g' {} \;
     ```
     These commands ensure your dashboard aligns with the Tron theme’s futuristic vibe. Check out [How to customize the Grafana user interface](https://volkovlabs.io/blog/how-to-customize-the-grafana-user-interface-8d70a42dc2b6/) for more customization options.
