# Unleashing Futuristic Dashboards with Tron Theme in Grafana 12

We’re thrilled to explore Grafana 12’s experimental themes, with a special focus on the **Tron theme**, launched to celebrate this major release! At Volkov Labs, we’re passionate about transforming data visualization, and the Tron theme’s neon-drenched, futuristic aesthetic offers a bold new way to elevate your dashboards.

In this post, we’ll dive into the Tron theme’s unique features, demonstrate how it integrates with our Business Suite plugins, and provide actionable steps to customize your Grafana experience.

## Introducing Grafana 12’s Experimental Themes

Grafana 12 brings a fresh set of experimental themes to personalize your dashboards, including **Sapphire Dusk**, **Tron**, **Gilded Grove**, **Gloom**, and **Desert Bloom**. These themes let you tailor the Grafana UI to match your style or use case, creating a more immersive experience. The **Tron theme**, inspired by the iconic sci-fi franchise, delivers glowing neon colors and a sleek, high-tech look ideal for modern, tech-focused environments.

To preview the Tron theme, click the user icon in the top-right corner of Grafana, select **Change theme**, and explore the options in the theme drawer.

## Why the Tron Theme Shines Bright

The Tron theme isn’t just a cosmetic update—it’s a game-changer for dashboard design. With vibrant neon blues and purples set against a dark background, it offers striking contrast that boosts readability and highlights critical data. Here’s why it stands out:

- **Tech and Gaming Dashboards**: Its futuristic vibe is a perfect match for tech industries or gaming analytics.
- **Nighttime Monitoring**: The dark, high-contrast design minimizes eye strain during extended sessions.
- **Branding Potential**: Pair it with custom logos and backgrounds for a unified, professional look.

We’ve tested the Tron theme extensively with our Business Suite plugins—such as **Business Table**, **Business Charts**, and **Business Calendar**—and the results are visually stunning. The neon accents amplify interactive elements like charts and event markers, blending functionality with eye-catching design.

## Supercharge Your Dashboards with Tron Theme and Volkov Labs Plugins

Combine the Tron theme with our Business Suite plugins to create dashboards that are as powerful as they are beautiful. Here’s how each plugin enhances the Tron experience:

### Business Table: Dynamic Data in Neon

The [**Business Table**](/plugins/business-table/) plugin supports advanced features like add/delete rows and diverse column types. Under the Tron theme, dynamic tables come alive with neon highlights, ensuring clarity for nested objects and markdown-supported comments.

### Business Charts: Visualizations That Pop

With the [**Business Charts**](/plugins/business-charts/) plugin, powered by Apache ECharts, you can create dynamic visualizations like scatter and boxplot charts. The Tron theme’s bold palette makes trends and outliers stand out, enhancing both aesthetics and insight.

### Business Calendar: Events in High-Tech Style

The [**Business Calendar**](/plugins/business-calendar/) plugin offers multi-language support and yearly views for event-driven analytics. Paired with the Tron theme, event bubbles and tooltips glow against the dark backdrop, delivering an intuitive experience for tracking schedules or alerts. [Check the latest release](/plugins/business-calendar/release/).
