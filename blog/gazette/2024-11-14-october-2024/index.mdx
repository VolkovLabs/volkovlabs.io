- [Total Business Suite downloads reached 26 millions](#total-business-suite-downloads)
- [3,600 YouTube subscribers](#growing-youtube-following)
- [Release news](#release-news)

Without further ado, let's summarize the October deliverables.

## Grafana 11.3

The [Scenes powered dashboards in Grafana 11.3 release](https://grafana.com/blog/2024/10/31/grafana-dashboards-are-now-powered-by-scenes-big-changes-same-ui/) introduced some breaking changes for our plugins. We thank the Grafana Engineering team for the timely collaboration in solving all issues. Special thanks to Ivan Ortega who worked with us on [GitHub issue](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/pull/93327).

Following the fix, we implemented [additional changes](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/94479) to ensure our plugins are up and running in Grafana 11.3 and provide unmatched user experience.

Currently, 6 of the Volkov Labs plugins have migrated to the latest Grafana 11.3 release. The rest will follow suit according to the individual release schedule and opened issues.

## Growing YouTube following

Usually, the summer months tend to be quieter months of the year, with general people activity picking up in all spheres starting from September. Cooler air signals to our brain that the vacation time is over, and we again need to roll up our sleeves.

Even expecting better activity in September-October, we are hit by a surprise to get more than 3,600 subscribers in total on our YouTube channel. I am happy to share this fantastic news with our community.

## Release news

In October 2024, we published 9 plugin releases, three for our upcoming celebrity, the [Business Table panel](/plugins/business-table/). This plugin arrived with a big bang and is here to stay as one of the most utilized panels.

## Blog

### Releases

:::info what is a release blog
Our release blogs are short descriptions of all essential changes in the release. At a glance, you can learn what is new and if there are any breaking changes. We provide detailed descriptions with examples, code snippets, step-by-step instructions, etcetera to make the release news as valuable and concise as possible.
:::

In October, the Business Table 1.5.0 got a thrilling experimental feature, **Nested objects/Comments**, with the following highlights:

- The nested objects/comments can be stored in any data source, the same as a table or completely different.
- An end user can add, edit, and delete nested objects/comments.
- Access to each action is configured separately and can follow Grafana roles or backend configuration.
- The card displaying nested objects/comments supports Markdown.

Every plugin goes hand in hand with the latest Grafana release to ensure version compatibility.

## YouTube Tutorials

:::info why YouTube?
For some people, it is so much easier to watch one time rather than read about it 1000 times. If you are one of them, we create YouTube videos for you!
:::

We cover almost the same materials as in our blog and documentation, but we have more opportunities for demonstration in the video format.
