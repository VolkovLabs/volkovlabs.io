## New team member

In January 2025, we were thrilled to welcome a new team member, Mikhail, on board. Our team is expanding, and we are proud to provide an inspiring and challenging atmosphere for those who are passionate about cutting-edge technologies and eager to share their work with a broad audience.

Mikhail will focus on our new product, [Business Intelligence](/big/). His experience in business applications and e-commerce is exactly what this demanding project requires. Welcome to the team, Mikhail. Your impressive results in just a few days of working with us have left us in awe.

## Development focus recalibration

Our popular open-source [Business Suite plugin collection](/plugins/) delivers on its mission non-stop. We reached a point where the features offered covered most user requirements. We stopped feeling challenged. The collection of plugins performs astonishingly with many delighted users.

For us, it is time to open new horizons and start something new. Of course, we will maintain the [Business Suite plugin collection](/plugins/) to add new, most requested features and ensure compatibility with the upcoming Grafana versions.

In 2025, we are excited to present a new product to the public - [Business Intelligence](/big/) for Grafana.

While working closely with the Community and helping to solve production use cases, we have accumulated quite a list of wishes for reimagined alerting functioning in Grafana.

Most asks were related to simplifying user interaction by having all controls in one UI place. Many users were eager to incorporate anomaly detection with reporting for self-hosted Grafana.

This is how the idea of the Business Intelligence platform was born. With time, going through a lot of brainstorming and Community feedback, we came up with a design that is easy to maintain for users and can advance in many directions.

The Grafana Business Intelligence platform consists of the following:

- Business Studio
  - It is your control panel.
  - Features a user-friendly interface with an overview of the whole system.
  - Users only need one Business Studio to work with the rest of the platform.
- Business Engine
  - One Business Engines serves one Grafana instance.
  - Does all the heavy lifting and all the necessary computing for all setup tasks.
- Business Alerting
  - It is the first part of the Busines Engine that is available.
  - Features alert systems based on Grafana panel queries, with support for customizable thresholds and variables, ensuring timely and relevant notifications for business metrics.
- Business Reporting
  - It is a Busines Engine part that is coming soon.
- More Business modules will be added
  - One of them is anomaly detection.
- Grafana is not part of the Business Intelligence
  - You can work with any Grafana instance type, such as OSS, Enterprise, or Cloud.

Such architecture allows users:

- to supervise as many Grafana instances as needed from central location (Business Studio),
- take advantage of the user-friendly interface,
- seamlessly integrate with new upcoming Business Engine features.

There is a possibility of facilitating all Grafana instances version control, new Grafana dashboard propagation (for instance, from the DEV to QA to production), etc.

## Release news

Following the new priority, we successfully published three consecutive business intelligence releases, each with significant improvements and enhancements.
