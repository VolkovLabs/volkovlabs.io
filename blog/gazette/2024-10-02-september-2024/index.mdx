# Business Gazette: Business Suite Enterprise, 24 million downloads, and Business Table

In this September issue of the Business Gazette:

- [Business Suite Enterprise](#business-suite-enterprise) is live and ready to welcome new customers
- [Total Business Suite downloads](#total-business-suite-downloads) reached 24 millions
- [Release news](#release-news)
- [Releases and solution blogs posts](#blog)
- [YouTube tutorials and releases](#youtube)

Without further ado, let's summarize the September deliverables.

## Business Suite Enterprise

Our open-source plugins are distinct from many others because of their exceptional quality and maintainability. That attracts Enterprise users who incorporate them into their production environments without hesitation or doubts.

While we strive to consider all possible scenarios, we understand that each customer has unique and specific needs. To ensure that no inquiry goes unanswered and to provide individual attention for plugin adjustments, we are launching the <b>Business Suite Enterprise</b> program.

Among many perks, it can provide:

- A transparent timeline for features and resolving issues
- The undivided account manager's attention
- Solutions for your unique use cases

To use the Business Suite Enterprise program to your advantage follow the [link](/pricing/) and subscribe.

## Total Business Suite downloads

You can follow our plugin statistics with us using the open-to-public [Release Dashboard](https://release.volkovlabs.io/).

Below is the plugin download dynamic by month starting from January 2024. It shows the constantly growing interest of the users.

We work around the clock to ensure every plugin gets a new release at least every 100 days. That aggressive schedule allows for the timely implementation of new features and the following of the latest Grafana changes to ensure our plugins and Grafana compatibility.

## Blog

### Releases

Our release blogs are short descriptions of all essential changes in the release. At a glance, you can learn what is new and if there are any breaking changes. We provide detailed descriptions with examples, code snippets, step-by-step instructions, etcetera to make the release news as valuable and concise as possible.

In September, we added the tenth plugin to our [Business Suite collection](/plugins/) and celebrated it with two releases:

<table>
  <tr style={{ border: 0 }}>
    <td style={{ border: 0, width: "50%" }}>
      <BlogPost id="business-table-1.3.0" />
    </td>
    <td style={{ border: 0 }}>
      <BlogPost id="business-table-1.2.0" />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

The Business Media panel release updates published on September 5.

<table>
  <tr style={{ border: 0 }}>
    <td style={{ border: 0, width: "50%" }}>
      <BlogPost id="business-media-6.1.0" />
    </td>
    <td style={{ border: 0 }} />
  </tr>
</table>

Every plugin goes hand in hand with the latest Grafana release to ensure version compatibility.

### Solutions

We created the **useful solutions** blog post category to recognize the blog posts containing the particular solutions for one of the most frequently asked subjects. Some Grafana community members participate in this marathon with us and happily share the solutions and ideas they come up with.

We are endlessly grateful for the contributions of our community members. Your insights and solutions are invaluable. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you would like to share your knowledge with the world!

Last month, our blog hosted two articles in the **useful solution** category.

<table>
  <tr style={{ border: 0 }}>
    <td style={{ border: 0, width: "50%" }}>
      <BlogPost id="datapicker-20240905" />
    </td>
    <td style={{ border: 0 }}>
      <BlogPost id="streaming-images-business-media-20240903" />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## YouTube

For some people, it is so much easier to watch one time rather than read about it 1000 times. If you are one of them, we create YouTube videos for you!

### Tutorials

We cover almost the same materials as in our blog and documentation, but we have more opportunities for demonstration in the video format.

<table>
  <tr style={{ border: 0 }}>
    <td style={{ border: 0, width: "50%" }}>
      <Youtube
        id="kOjt9Bl3VQo"
        title="The video below exhibits all the Business Table panel version 1.3.0 features."
      />
    </td>
    <td style={{ border: 0 }}>
      <Youtube
        id="vda3jbtLnMM"
        title="The video below showcases the power of the visual editor in the Business Charts panel. This tool can revolutionize users' work, especially for those who prefer to minimize their coding tasks."
      />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Releases

Our shorts are made to accompany the release blog posts. They are the video versions of the new feature list. In the past month, we issued two YouTube shorts.

<table>
  <tr style={{ border: 0 }}>
    <td style={{ border: 0, width: "50%" }}>
      <Shorts id="3GsGKnd-nok" title="The Business Table 1.2.0 for Grafana." />
    </td>
    <td style={{ border: 0 }}>
      <Shorts
        id="1L_4ApL_qI4"
        title="The Business Media panel 6.1.0 for Grafana."
      />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
