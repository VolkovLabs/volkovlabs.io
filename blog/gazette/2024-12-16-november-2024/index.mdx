# Business Gazette: Master educators award, Release dashboard tutorial and 28 millions downloads

In this November issue of the Business Gazette:

- [Master Educator award](#master-educator)
- [Release dashboard tutorial](#release-dashboard-tutorial)
- [Total Business Suite downloads reached 28 millions](#total-business-suite-downloads)
- [Release news](#release-news)
- [Massive documentation improvement](#massive-documentation-improvement)

Without further ado, let's summarize the November deliverables.

## Master educator

December was a truly festive month for us as we were honored with the Master Educator Grafana Champions Award. This award is a testament to the champions' consistent production of high-quality educational content, such as blog posts, tutorials, and video guides. These resources are instrumental in unlocking the full potential of Grafana. They provide valuable insights and accessible learning materials which is a key factor in fostering Grafana's growth and adoption.

I wish you can watch the online ceremony, it was a blast.
Two feelings I experienced right after:

- Grafana is doing an outstanding job with the championship program.
- Community recognition feels special and, most importantly, inspiring. We already have a packed roadmap for the next year! Stay tuned for more products, ideas, solutions and tutorials from us!

## Release dashboard tutorial

Our most popular Youtube video is ["Create your Business Grafana dashboard | Step by step for analysts | Grafana Tutorial"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNCKbGfAU0Q) with 34K views so far.

Even though, the second popular video, ["JSON API and Infinity Data Source tutorial for Grafana | How to display the unemployment rate"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Uj1n4Cr88) is very close in popularity, the fact still shows where the most uncertanties for Grafana community are. People want to start with Grafana dashboards right away to see the available functionality and be able to evaluate if Grafana fits their project needs.

We at Volkov Labs created myriads of various dashboards, overcoming hundreds of pitfalls and solving many production issues. Sharing the details behind one of our most utilized dashboards seems a natural continuation of our mission.

We use the [Release dashboard](https://release.volkovlabs.io/) project on a daily basis to track our open-spource plugin development.

/>

The brilliant idea to share how this dashboard is configured took a while to appear, but when it arrived, it seemed so obvious for many reasons:

- The dashboard features the most used Grafana core visualization, [Time Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpOazX67GSo), in many different configurations.
- In addition, it also has some variations of the [Business Charts](https://volkovlabs.io/plugins/business-charts/) panel, which serve as good samples for this multifaceted panel.
- What is more, the [Business Calendar](https://volkovlabs.io/plugins/business-calendar/) is a nice final touch to illustrate another possible view of the data.

This dashboard combines many things we love about Grafana, among them the ability to follow the existing user requirements closely without unnecessary bundled features and, people's favorite, the simplicity of configuration.

An honorable mention of this project goes to the [Business Forms](https://volkovlabs.io/plugins/business-forms/) panel, which provides an interface to our release manager to enter release specifics into the Timescale data source using the Grafana dashboard.

Feel free to spend a minute or two reviewing the [dashboard itself](https://release.volkovlabs.io/), reading the detailed blog post or watching the video.

## Total Business Suite downloads

The total downloads are rushing towards the 30,000,000 mark. I wonder if we can reach it before the end of the year.

## Release news

:::tip FYI
Every updated plugin is campatible with Grafana 11.3 scenes-powered dashboards.
:::

In November 2024, we published six plugin releases, focusing on our rising star, the [Business Table](/plugins/business-table/) panel. This plugin keeps staggering users with its functionality. We are happy to see the unstoppable demand from the community.

/>

One of the most requested features for the [Business Table](/plugins/business-table/) was [add and delete a row](/blog/business-table-1.9.0/#ability-to-add-and-delete-a-row). It became available starting from version 1.9.0

  src="/img/blog/2024-12-04-business-table-1.9.0/table-add-delete-row.gif"
  width="70%"
/>

This feature also means that the [Business Table](/plugins/business-table/) becomes the second out of the [Business Suite](/plugins/) collection after the [Business Forms](/plugins/business-forms/), to allow transmitting data back into the connected data source.

In addition, we spiced up the [Business Table](/plugins/business-table/) with many new [display column types](/blog/business-table-1.9.0/#new-column-types) and [editable types](/blog/business-table-1.9.0/#new-editor-types).

The [Visual Editor](/plugins/business-charts/visualeditor) of the [Business Charts](/plugins/business-charts/) 6.5.0, in addition to all existing, also supports [scatter](/blog/echarts-panel-6.5.0/#scatter) and [boxplot](/blog/echarts-panel-6.5.0/#boxplot) types.

<table>
  <tr style={{ border: 0 }}>
    <td style={{ border: 0, width: "50%" }}>
      <BlogPost id="business-table-1.9.0" />
    </td>
    <td style={{ border: 0 }}>
      <BlogPost id="echarts-panel-6.5.0" />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

In November, the [Business Calendar](/plugins/business-calendar/) 3.8.0 got a improved [**Year**](/blog/calendar-panel-3.8.0/#year-view) layout as well as [panel-specific language(datetime) format](/blog/calendar-panel-3.8.0/#panel-specific-languagedatetime-format). The second means that one dashboard can simultaneously contain many different languages (formats).

The [Business Forms](/plugins/business-forms/) become even more dynamic with release 4.9.0 because now, besides all visual elements, sections can be generated dynamically as well.

<table>
  <tr style={{ border: 0 }}>
    <td style={{ border: 0, width: "50%" }}>
      <BlogPost id="calendar-panel-3.8.0" />
    </td>
    <td style={{ border: 0 }}>
      <BlogPost id="form-panel-4.9.0" />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Massive documentation improvement

Keeping documentation up-to-date is the real challenge of fast-expanding plugin functionality, especially if not only simple features are added but the whole configuration approach changes

In November, we found time to revamp the documentation(add the link here) for the [Business Table](/plugins/business-table) panel.

Let us know if the schema below makes it easy to follow the configurational steps.
