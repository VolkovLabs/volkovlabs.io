## Release Dashboard Tutorial

Our mission at Volkov Labs is to empower the Grafana community with practical tools and knowledge. One of our most popular resources is the YouTube video ["Create Your Business Grafana Dashboard"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNCKbGfAU0Q), which has garnered over 34,000 views. This highlights the community's eagerness to dive into Grafana dashboards and explore their potential.

To address this demand, we’ve created a detailed tutorial on configuring our **[Release Dashboard](https://release.volkovlabs.io/)**, a tool we use daily to track Business Suite plugin development. This dashboard showcases Grafana's versatility and simplicity.

## Plugin Release News

November 2024 saw **six plugin releases**, with a special focus on the rapidly growing [Business Table](/plugins/business-table/) panel. Here's a summary of the updates:

### Business Table 1.9.0

Added the highly requested [add/delete row feature](/blog/business-table-1.9.0/#ability-to-add-and-delete-a-row), new [display column types](/blog/business-table-1.9.0/#new-column-types), and [editable types](/blog/business-table-1.9.0/#new-editor-types). This makes it the second plugin after [Business Forms](/plugins/business-forms/) to support data transmission back to the source.

## Documentation Revamp

Keeping documentation current with rapidly evolving plugin features is a challenge. In November, we overhauled the documentation for the [Business Table](/plugins/business-table/) panel to make configuration steps clearer.
