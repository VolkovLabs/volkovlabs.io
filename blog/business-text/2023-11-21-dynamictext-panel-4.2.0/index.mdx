# After content render, text wrapping, and new handlebars in Business Text 4.2.0

We're excited to announce the release of the Business Text panel 4.2.0. This feature release includes the following updates:

- Added **JavaScript->After Content Ready** option to execute after the DOM rendered.
- Added an option to enable/disable text wrapping to support empty lines in HTML.
- Added handlebars (startsWith, endsWith, match).
- Added compatibility with Grafana 10.2.1.

## 4.4 million downloads

We celebrated 2 million downloads this February. Since then many more fundamental features have been added like JavaScript, CSS styles and Grafana events. We suspect them to be the primary reason for the extreme adaptability acceleration.

More than four million downloads as of today! Thank you for your trust!

## JavaScript code after content ready

This is a new panel option to specify another JavaScript code. This one will be executed after the **Content** option rendered.

Another important change to point out is we reorganized the UI positioning of panel options for a more intuitive display.

Starting from this release, you see separate categories for:

- Content (with Content and Default content inside),
- JavaScript (with the Before and After rendering options inside),
- CSS styles.

For a cleaner view, you can control which options are visible in the **Dynamic Text** category.

## The Rendering Order

Below are two schemas of the rendering order in the Dynamic text plugin. They represent the same thing.

The first is oriented toward the general public and the second is targeted to answer developers' questions.

### For Users

## Content Wrapping

We added a new option **Wrap automatically in paragraphs** into the **Content** category.

- If enabled, every row of the content will be wrapped into paragraph `<p>` tags.
- If disabled, every row will NOT be wrapped into paragraph `<p>` tags.

The example below shows the Content that does not contain any spaces. In that event, the new parameter is irrelevant and both Enabled and Disabled modes generate the same output.

  src="/img/blog/2023-11-21-dynamictext-panel-4.2.0/no-empty-lines.png"
/>

The example below shows the Content that contains one empty line and how the form will be interpreted with Enabled and Dispaled modes.

The code used in the examples above:

```html
<figure>
  <ul>
    <li>In Progress : 34</li>
    <li>Completed : 5</li>
  </ul>
</figure>
```

## New handlebars

In the **JavaScript->before rendering content** option a user can register handlebars which are functions to use in the rest of the code.

The Business Text panel has plenty of predefined handlebars that are registered automatically and ready to use. All of them are listed on our [documentation page](/plugins/business-text/helpers/).

In this release, we added three more:

### startsWith

Returns true if the variable starts with a specified value.
Example:

```md
|Name| My Value| |---|---|
{{#each @root}}
{{#if (startsWith @key "My_")}}
| {{@key}} | {{this}} |
{{/if}}
{{/each}}
```

### endsWith

Returns true if the variable ends with a specified value.
Example:

```md
|Name| My Keys| |---|---|
{{#each @root}}
{{#if (endsWith @key "_key")}}
| {{@key}} | {{this}} |
{{/if}}
{{/each}}=
```

### match

Returns true if the variable matches with a specified value.
Example:

```md
|Key| Value| |---|---|
{{#each @root}}
{{#if (match @key "^(Country|Street|Post)")}}
| {{@key}} | {{this}} |
{{/if}}
{{/each}}
```
