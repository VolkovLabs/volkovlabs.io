# Why the Business Text Panel for Grafana is Your Business Powerhouse

At Volkov Labs, we see Grafana’s strength in its adaptability—bridging observability, business intelligence, and more. Our [Business Text panel](/plugins/business-text/) embodies this vision, earning its title as the "Business Powerhouse" of Grafana visualizations. With over 9.5 million downloads, it’s a cornerstone of our [Business Suite](/plugins/), turning raw data into dynamic, actionable dashboards. What makes it so special? Let’s explore.

## A Swiss Army Knife for Business

The Business Text panel isn’t just one tool—it’s a versatile kit. It transforms plain text or tables into polished information cards, but its capabilities go far beyond. Here’s what it brings to the table:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="markdown" label="Markdown & Handlebars" default>
    Craft rich layouts with Markdown and inject live data using Handlebars
    templating—ideal for reports or custom displays.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="javascript" label="JavaScript">
    Add custom JavaScript (pre- or post-render) to manipulate data, query APIs,
    or integrate libraries, unlocking endless possibilities.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="css" label="CSS">
    Style your text with custom CSS and Grafana variables for a branded,
    professional look.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="globals" label="Global Helpers">
    Format time ranges like `__from` and `__to`, or use built-in helpers for
    nested objects and localization.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This blend of features makes it a chameleon—adapting to any business need with ease.

## Simplifying the Complex

A true powerhouse simplifies what’s tough. Business Text does this by breaking the mold of rigid Grafana panels. Need a news feed, status report, or interactive form? It’s got you covered:

- Pair it with [Business News](/plugins/business-news/) to style RSS feeds into sleek layouts.
- Build dynamic status cards with real-time data from any source.
- Use [D3.js](/plugins/business-text/external/d3/) for custom visualizations beyond core Grafana capabilities.

A community member dubbed it a “mini development framework within Grafana”—a perfect description. Its JavaScript and external library support dissolve traditional limits, letting you create exactly what your business needs.

## Shaped by the Community

From its origins as the Dynamic Text plugin—a simple news feed enhancer—Business Text evolved into a powerhouse thanks to Grafana’s community. Adding JavaScript and library support was a game-changer, fueling its rise.
