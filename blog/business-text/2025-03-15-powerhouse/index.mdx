# Why the Business Text Panel for Grafana is Your Business Powerhouse

At Volkov Labs, we've always believed that Grafana's true power lies in its flexibility — its ability to adapt to virtually any use case, from observability to business intelligence and beyond. That's why we're so proud of our [Business Text panel](/plugins/business-text/), a plugin that's earned a reputation as the "Business Powerhouse" of Grafana visualizations.

With over 9.5 million downloads and counting, this panel has become a cornerstone of our Business Suite, empowering users to transform raw data into dynamic, actionable, and visually compelling dashboards. But what makes it so versatile? Let's dive into the reasons why the Business Text panel is the multi-faceted tool you didn't know you needed in your Grafana toolkit.

## A Tool for Every Business Need

Much like a business powerhouse, the Business Text panel isn't just one solution — it's a suite of capabilities, ready to tackle a variety of challenges. At its core, it's designed to take plain text or table data and turn it into polished, easy-to-read information cards. But that's just the starting point. Here's what's in its arsenal.

### Markdown and Handlebars Support

Need to format text with bold headings, lists, or dynamic variables? The panel renders Markdown and uses Handlebars templating to inject live data into your visualizations, making it perfect for creating custom layouts or reports.

### JavaScript Flexibility

Want to go beyond static displays? With the ability to add custom JavaScript — executed either before or after rendering—you can manipulate data, query APIs, or even integrate external libraries. It's like having a mini development framework right inside Grafana.

### CSS Styling

Style matters. With support for custom CSS and Grafana dashboard variables, you can tailor the look and feel of your text to match your brand or use case, ensuring your dashboards are as beautiful as they are functional.

### Global Variables and Helpers

Display time ranges like `__from` and `__to` in your preferred format, or leverage built-in Handlebars helpers for nested objects and internationalization. It's all about giving you control.

This combination of features means the Business Text panel isn't limited to one job — it can shape, refine, and deliver your data however your business requires.

## Streamlining Complex Operations

One of the standout qualities of a business powerhouse is its ability to simplify tasks that might otherwise require specialized tools. The Business Text panel does just that for Grafana users. Imagine you're building a dashboard that needs to display a news feed, a custom status report, or even an interactive form. Traditionally, you'd be stuck with rigid time-series panels or tables that don't quite fit the bill.

With Business Text, you can:

- Pull in RSS feeds (pair it with our [Business News](/plugins/business-news/) data source!) and format them into a sleek, readable layout.
- Create dynamic status cards that update based on real-time data from any source.
- Embed external JavaScript libraries like [D3.js](/plugins/business-text/external/d3/) to craft bespoke visualizations that Grafana's core panels can't handle.

A community member once called it a “mini development framework within Grafana,” and we couldn't agree more. By letting you write arbitrary JavaScript and load external resources, it streamlines the limitations of traditional panels, giving you the freedom to dream up — and build — whatever your business demands.

## Honed by Community Insights

The Business Text panel didn't start as a business powerhouse — it evolved into one, thanks to the Grafana community. What began as the Dynamic Text plugin, a simple tool for prettifying news feeds, grew into a robust solution as users pushed its boundaries.

When we added JavaScript functionality and external library support, the plugin's adaptability soared. Today, it's used for everything from home dashboards to enterprise-grade applications, with users praising its ability to “transform what I'm doing with Grafana dashboards” (as one Redditor put it).

Take, for example, its role in reviving beloved plugins like [Flowchart](/plugins/business-text/external/). By integrating external libraries, Business Text breathes new life into legacy tools, proving its worth as a bridge between Grafana's past and future.

It's this adaptability that's driven its popularity — over 9 million downloads and counting—and earned it a spot as our most beloved plugin.

## A Solution for Every Professional

Whether you're a hobbyist tweaking a home dashboard or an enterprise team solving complex business problems, the Business Text panel fits the bill. It's part of our open-source Business Suite, meaning it's free to use and backed by detailed documentation, video tutorials, and a vibrant community.

And for those on Grafana Enterprise or Grafana Cloud, it slots seamlessly into your workflows — no “business” subscription required, unless you require our Enterprise grade support as a part of the [Business Suite Enterprise](/pricing/).

Need to display a custom datepicker? Extend it with D3.js. Want to anonymize data for a demo? Use JavaScript to mask it on the fly. Building a real-time status board? Combine Markdown, CSS, and live data for a polished result.

The possibilities are endless because the Business Text panel doesn't dictate how you use it — it empowers you to decide.

## The Strongest Asset in the Suite

As we've said before, the Business Suite is all about solving real-world problems with intuitive, powerful tools. The Business Text panel embodies that mission.

It's not just a visualization plugin — it's a platform for innovation, a hub for customization, and a cornerstone for business success. Paired with other Suite plugins like [Business Forms](/plugins/business-forms/) or [Business Charts](/plugins/business-charts/), it turns Grafana into a full-fledged application platform.

So, why is the Business Text panel a business powerhouse? Because it's compact, versatile, and ready for anything your organization throws at it. Whether you're refining data, assembling a quick solution, or unlocking a new use case, it's the one tool you'll rely on time and again.
