## Community use case

We are consistently impressed by the innovative ways that the Grafana community uses the latest features of Business Text panel. One particularly fascinating use case is the creation of tabs using CSS styles, JavaScript code, and a combination of Handlebars and HTML. This functionality was previously only available with custom panels, but our plugin makes it possible to implement these tabs.

## Magic (JavaScript) Trio

One of the three plugins that complete Grafana is Business Text panel. With Business Text, Data Manipulation, and Business Charts panel you can create fully functional web applications meeting your needs and expectations.

## Select Editor to display

To make the plugin's panel easier to use, we have hidden the default Content, JavaScript code, and styles editors by default. However, if you have modified the default content or are already using JavaScript code or CSS styles, the editors will be displayed even if they are not selected.

/>

In most cases, you won't need to modify the default content, JavaScript code, or CSS styles. We prefer the minimalist design of displaying only one content editor, and we hope you will too.

## Styles editor

Using the dedicated code editor with CSS syntax highlighting, you can create new CSS styles or alter the default ones.

### Padding and margins

To display content without padding and margins, you need to override the parent CSS style.

```css
& {
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
}
```

## Code Syntax Highlighting

Code syntax highlighting is based on the `highlight.js` library, which supports key programming languages.

### Styling

We included the Accessibility (A11Y) syntax highlighting style for light and dark themes. You can override it in the styles editor by copying one of the styles from the [project source files](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/tree/main/src/styles).
