# Handlebars partials, expandable editors, and migration updates in Business Text 5.3.0

We're excited to announce the release of the Business Text panel 5.3.0. This release includes the following updates:

## Downloads

In the blink of an eye, 7,000,000 downloads of the Business Text plugin turned into almost 8,000,000! It feels a bit surreal, but the numbers are in! :clap:

## External handlebars templates(partials)

In addition to external CSS files and JavaScript libraries, starting from this release, you can use external [handlebar template](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/partials.html) pieces.

## Expandable editors for content, JS and CSS.

For a better user experience, we added the expand the code area button.

  width='20%'

You can find this button in all areas where you might need to have an extensive piece of code.

## Updated helpers migration from older versions.

In the previous release of the Business text, we published a mandatory migration guide for the [`context` parameters](/blog/dynamictext-panel-5.0.0-20240619/#context-migration-guide).

Since then, many users have contacted us, mentioning their struggle with the migration process. In this release, we introduce automatic migration (where possible) to mitigate the migration effort. 

Based of the feedback, that change lifted the migration burden significantly. However, please be aware that you might still have problems with some marginal cases. 

## Before render JavaScript code capability

Starting from this release, you can import the external JavaScript libraries in the **Before content rendering** option. Previosly, that was possible only in the **After content ready**.
