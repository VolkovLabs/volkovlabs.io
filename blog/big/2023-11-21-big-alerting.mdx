# Business Alerting: Reinventing Alerts in Grafana

Through close collaboration with the Grafana Community, we've collected valuable feedback on improving alerting—calling for simpler controls, a unified interface, and anomaly detection with reporting for self-hosted environments. This led to the creation of **Business Alerting**, a reimagined solution tailored for business users.

In this video, I introduce alerting fundamentals, explore native Grafana components, and share our vision for Business Alerting. The article below dives deeper into these topics:

## Alerting Basics

Alerting monitors data changes and triggers responses when predefined rules are violated. It consists of three core components:

1. **Alert Rule**: Specifies what to monitor, including time frame, frequency, query (e.g., SQL, PromQL), and thresholds.
2. **Alert Record**: Captures instances when data breaches thresholds.
3. **Alert Action**: Executes a predefined response to the recorded breach.

You define the "what" and "how," and when a rule is breached, records trigger actions—a straightforward yet powerful mechanism.

## Native Alerting vs. Business Alerting

The following diagram compares Grafana’s native alerting with our vision for Business Alerting:

/>

### Native Alerting

- **Rules**: Configured through the Alerting UI.
- **Records**: Managed by the Alert Manager, which logs breaches as annotations (vertical lines on Time Series) for backend data sources.
- **Actions**: Supported by a powerful notification system (text, Slack, email, OnCall), though it has a steep learning curve. Webhooks for third-party APIs are possible but complex to set up.

### Business Alerting

We’ve reimagined all three components for simplicity and accessibility:

#### Business Alerting Panel

A unified, user-friendly interface streamlines rule creation for business users. Key features include:

- **Title**: Assign a name to your alert.
- **Schedule**: Define frequency using CRON expressions.
- **Target Dashboard/Panel**: Automatically pull queries and thresholds from dropdown menus.
- **Time Range**: Use dashboard defaults or set custom ranges.
- **Action**: Select from pre-configured webhooks.
- **Annotation**: Optionally disable annotation records.

Future updates will support managing hundreds of alerts with advanced grouping and filtering capabilities.

#### Business Engine

Our alternative to the Alert Manager offers:

- Seamless integration with dashboard queries and thresholds, eliminating redundant configuration.
- Deployment in a separate container for a flexible, scalable architecture.
- Future support for AI-driven anomaly detection.

Connect to it using the Business Engine data source:

#### Webhooks Configuration

A dedicated panel simplifies webhook management, with edit mode providing:

- Name and type (HTTP or Test).
- Request URL and method (currently limited to POST).

## Why Business Alerting?

By unifying controls, prioritizing usability, and planning cutting-edge features, Business Alerting makes Grafana’s alerting capabilities accessible to non-technical users, empowering business teams to act on data insights effectively.
