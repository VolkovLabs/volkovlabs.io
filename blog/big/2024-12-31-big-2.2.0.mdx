### Effortlessly Add and Remove Business Engines

2. Specify the **Engine URL** to connect to your Grafana instance.
3. Provide a valid **Token** for authentication.

### Streamline Alert Rule Management

The **Alert Rules** tab offers powerful tools to:

- Create new rules with custom settings.
- Toggle rules between **Active** and **Paused** states.
- Track rule statuses like **Scheduled**, **OK**, **Alerting**, or **Error**.
- Pause, start, or delete rules as needed.

/>

Stay tuned for upcoming features like rule grouping and filtering to manage large sets of alerts effortlessly. For now, here’s how alert statuses flow:

  width="50%"
/>

When adding a new rule, configure:

- **Title**: A descriptive name for the rule.
- **Schedule**: Frequency using CRON syntax (e.g., every minute or daily).
- **Target Dashboard/Panel**: Automatically fetch queries and thresholds.
- **Time Range**: Use dashboard defaults or set a custom range.
- **Evaluation**: Choose **Thresholds** (based on panel data) or **Regex Pattern** (search specific fields).
- **Action**: Link to a pre-configured API or action.
- **Annotation**: Attach to **Panel**, **Dashboard**, or disable it.

### Configure Alert Actions with Precision

On the **Actions** tab, you can:

- Add custom actions for alerts.
- Remove actions (except the protected **default** action).

<Image
  title="Setting up alert actions for automated responses."
  src="/img/blog/2024-12-31-big-2.2.0/tab-actions.png"
/>

When creating a new action, specify:

- **Title**: Name of the action.
- **Type**: Choose between HTTP or Logs.
- **HTTP Details**: Define URL, method, and optional headers.
- **Message**: Customize with Handlebars templates.
- **Test Connectivity**: Validate the API endpoint before saving.

## Seamless Integration with Grafana 11 HTTP API

This release fully supports Grafana 11’s HTTP API. While compatibility with Grafana 10.x may work, it’s not officially tested—proceed with caution. Rest assured, we’ll continue to align with future Grafana updates for uninterrupted service.

## Simplified Setup with Environment Variables

Configuring Business Intelligence is now easier with default values for most environment variables. Only these seven are mandatory:

- Timescale database connection details (for data storage).
- Grafana URL and Token (via Service Account for API access).

<Code
  url="https://github.com/VolkovLabs/business-intelligence/blob/main/.env"
  language="shell"
/>

## Powerful New Engine APIs

### Access Environment Information

Check all environment variables directly from the **Environment** tab using the [GET /environment endpoint](/big/api/). Editing capabilities are planned for a future update.

/>

### Track Alert Status Timelines

The [GET timeline endpoint](/big/api/) provides a streamlined history of alert state changes, filtering out duplicate entries for clarity.

**Full Alert History Example:**

```csv
date                      Previous            New
1/1/25, 10:29:01 AM       OK                  Alerting
1/1/25, 10:28:01 AM       OK                  OK
1/1/25, 10:27:01 AM       OK                  OK
1/1/25, 10:26:01 AM       OK                  OK
1/1/25, 10:25:01 AM       OK                  OK
1/1/25, 10:24:01 AM       OK                  OK
```

**Filtered Timeline Output:**

```csv
date                      Previous            New
1/1/25, 10:29:01 AM       OK                  Alerting
```
