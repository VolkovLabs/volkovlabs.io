# Business Intelligence 1.6.0: Variables, Prometheus, and Alert History

We’re excited to unveil **Business Intelligence 1.6.0**, a significant release from Volkov Labs that marks a major step forward for the [Business Intelligence platform](/big/). Transitioning from a proof-of-concept to a robust development milestone, this update introduces powerful features and enhancements, including:

- **Dashboard variables** for streamlined alerting.
- **Prometheus data source** integration.
- Built-in **Prometheus monitoring** for system health.
- Enhanced **UI functionality** for better user experience.
- New **Alert History** visualization for deeper insights.

Take a quick look at what’s new:

## Dashboard Variables for Flexible Alerting

Dashboard variables revolutionize alert configuration by enabling dynamic and scalable setups. Consider a scenario where you’re monitoring multiple devices with varying CPU thresholds (e.g., 0-2% for some, over 2% for others). Without variables, you’d need separate alert rules for each device—a manageable task for a few, but a daunting challenge for hundreds.

With Business Intelligence 1.6.0, a single alert rule combined with variable-driven **Overrides** can handle diverse thresholds effortlessly. See it in action in a Time Series panel:

Here’s how the rule setup looks with variables:

### Prometheus Data Source Support

This release brings full variable support for the **Prometheus data source**, ensuring seamless integration. We’re actively working to extend this capability to other popular data sources in future updates.

## Built-In Prometheus Monitoring

Keep a close eye on the BI Engine itself with our new Prometheus middleware and a dedicated monitoring container. This built-in solution collects critical system health metrics, which you can visualize using a [pre-built dashboard](https://github.com/VolkovLabs/business-intelligence/blob/main/provisioning/dashboards/engine.json). It’s an ideal way to monitor the system that powers your observability.

The BI Engine comprises two key components, each exposing metrics for monitoring:

- **API Server**: Accessible at `engine:3001`
- **Scheduler**: Accessible at `engine:3002`

## Streamlined Alert Rules Workflow

The user-facing alert workflow is now more intuitive, with Prometheus enabling detailed troubleshooting and system reporting behind the scenes:

## Enhanced User Interface Features

### Actions Page

We’ve renamed the **Webhooks** section to **Actions** to better reflect standard alerting terminology ([Alert rule → Alert record → Alert action](/big/alerting/)).

### Annotations Support

In Edit mode under the **Action** category, the new **Add Annotations** option allows you to attach annotations to a specific panel or the entire dashboard, providing greater flexibility in alert documentation.

### Event Details View

For alert rules in **Alerting** or **Error** states, you can now click **Details** on an alert card and expand the **Event Details** section to dive into specific information about the event.

## Alert History Visualization

A new **Alerts History** option in the BI Engine data source’s **Request** parameter allows you to retrieve and display alert history in any visualization panel. For example, here’s how it looks in a Table view:
