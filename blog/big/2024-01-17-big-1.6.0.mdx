# Business Intelligence 1.6.0: Variables, Prometheus, and Alert History

We’re thrilled to announce Business Intelligence 1.6.0, a pivotal release from Volkov Labs that evolves the [Business Intelligence platform](/big/) from proof-of-concept to a robust development milestone. Key updates include:

- **Dashboard variables** support for streamlined alerting.
- **Prometheus data source** integration.
- Built-in **Prometheus monitoring**.
- Expanded **UI functionality**.
- New **Alert History** visualization.

Watch the overview:

## Dashboard Variables Support

Variables transform alert configuration. Imagine monitoring two similar devices with slightly different CPU thresholds (e.g., 0-2% vs. over 2%). Without variables, you’d need separate rules for each—manageable for a few, but a nightmare for hundreds.

Now, one alert rule with variable-driven **Overrides** handles it all. Here’s how it looks in a Time Series panel:

And the rule setup with variables:

### Prometheus Data Source

This release ensures variable support for Prometheus, with plans to expand to other popular data sources soon.

## Built-In Prometheus Monitoring

Monitor the BI Engine itself with new Prometheus middleware and a dedicated container. This built-in solution collects system health stats, viewable in a [pre-built dashboard](https://github.com/VolkovLabs/business-intelligence/blob/main/provisioning/dashboards/engine.json)—perfect for observing your observability system.

The BI Engine’s two components provide metrics:

- **API Server**: `engine:3001`
- **Scheduler**: `engine:3002`

## Alert Rules Workflow

Here’s the user-facing workflow, with Prometheus enabling troubleshooting and system reporting:

## UI Enhancements

### Actions Page

Renamed from **Webhooks** to **Actions** to align with alerting terminology ([Alert rule-Alert record-Alert action](/big/alerting/)).

### Annotations

In Edit mode > **Action** category, the **Add Annotations** option now lets you attach annotations to a specific panel or the entire dashboard.

/>

### Event Details

For rules in **Alerting** or **Error** states, click **Details** on an alert card, then the **Event Details** header to inspect specifics.

## Alert History Visualization

A new **Alerts History** option in the BI Engine data source’s **Request** parameter lets you display alert history in any visualization panel—like this Table view:
