In a world driven by data, staying ahead requires tools that not only keep up but push boundaries. We are thrilled to unveil **Business Intelligence 3.7.0**, a release packed with groundbreaking features, intuitive UI enhancements, and performance optimizations to the [Business Intelligence platform](/big/).

Designed to empower users with smarter, faster, and more secure data-driven decision-making. Let’s dive into the key updates and improvements in this release.

## What’s New in Business Intelligence 3.7.0?

This release elevates Business Intelligence with cutting-edge UI enhancements, advanced thresholding and clustering capabilities, improved alert management, streamlined environment configurations, and powerful AI-driven features. We’ve also introduced robust database optimizations and enhanced security measures to ensure a seamless and protected user experience.

Dive into the details of each innovation below.

- **AI-Driven Actions**: With integrated support for Grok 4 and Anthropic AI, the engine can dynamically generate action messages for alerts and reports based on JSON payloads. This enables _smarter automation_ and highly tailored responses.
- **Thresholds Innovation**: Our new auto-thresholding feature uses standard deviation with high and low marks to create precise and adaptive alert triggers, enabling better decision-making.
- **UI Enhancements**: We’ve introduced a dynamic home page with customizable quick links, enabling faster access to key features. This update significantly improves navigation and boosts _user productivity_.
- **Clustering Optimization**: Enhanced grouping mechanisms for alert rules and reports on load balancing ensure _improved performance_ and scalability, even in high-traffic environments.
- **Alert Rules Visibility**: Gain deeper insights into alert lifecycles with added visibility into alert state duration, allowing for greater clarity and control in managing alerts.
- **Environment Configuration**: We’ve refined environment settings by splitting them into dedicated pages for Engine, Grafana, Processing, AI, and Database. This organized and intuitive setup enhances the configuration experience.
- **Screenshot Functionality**: Sharing and archiving visual data is now easier than ever with new download and copy-to-clipboard buttons for screenshots.
- **Database Timezone Handling**: We’ve adopted the `timestamptz` field type to manage dates with timezones, ensuring accurate and consistent time data across global operations.
- **Database Security**: Security has been bolstered by encrypting tokens and passwords in environment settings, adding an extra layer of protection for sensitive data.

Let’s dive deeper into how these features can revolutionize your Grafana workflows!

## AI-Driven Actions

Our **AI-Driven Actions** feature introduces a revolutionary way to automate workflows with intelligence. With integrated support for Grok 4 and Anthropic AI, the Business Intelligence engine can now dynamically generate action messages for alerts and reports based on JSON payloads.
