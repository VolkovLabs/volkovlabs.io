# Business Alerting: Reinventing Alerts in Grafana

Working closely with the Grafana Community, we’ve gathered a wealth of feedback on enhancing alerting—simpler controls, unified UI, and anomaly detection with reporting for self-hosted setups. This inspired **Business Alerting**, a reimagined approach designed for business users.

In this video, I cover alerting basics, native Grafana components, and our vision for Business Alerting. The article expands on these points with added depth:

## Alerting Basics

Alerting tracks data changes and responds when rules are breached. Its three core components are:

1. **Alert Rule**: Defines what to monitor—time frame, frequency, query (e.g., SQL, PromQL), and thresholds.
2. **Alert Record**: Logs when data exceeds thresholds.
3. **Alert Action**: Executes a response to the record.

You set the “what” and “how,” and when rules break, records trigger actions—simple yet powerful.

## Native Alerting vs. Business Alerting

This schema compares Grafana’s native alerting with our Business Alerting vision:

/>

### Native Alerting

- **Rules**: Created via the Alerting UI.
- **Records**: Managed by the Alert Manager, which logs breaches as annotations (vertical lines on Time Series) for backend data sources.
- **Actions**: Handled by a robust notification system (text, Slack, email, OnCall) with a steep learning curve. Webhooks (3rd-party APIs) are possible but tricky to implement.

### Business Alerting

We’ve rethought all three:

#### Business Alerting Panel

A single, intuitive screen simplifies rule creation for business users. Key settings include:

- **Title**: Name your alert.
- **Schedule**: Set frequency with CRON expressions.
- **Target Dashboard/Panel**: Auto-pull queries and thresholds from dropdowns.
- **Time Range**: Use dashboard defaults or customize.
- **Action**: Pick from pre-configured webhooks.
- **Annotation**: Opt out to skip annotation records.

Future enhancements will support hundreds of alerts with grouping and filtering.

#### Business Engine

Our Alert Manager replacement:

- Leverages dashboard queries and thresholds, cutting redundant setup.
- Runs in a separate container for flexible architecture.
- Future-ready for AI-driven anomaly detection.

Connect via the Business Engine data source:

#### Webhooks Configuration

A dedicated panel lists webhooks, with edit mode offering:

- Name and type (HTTP or Test).
- Request URL and method (POST only, for now).

## Why Business Alerting?

By consolidating controls, enhancing usability, and planning advanced features, we’re making alerting accessible beyond technical experts—empowering business teams in Grafana.
