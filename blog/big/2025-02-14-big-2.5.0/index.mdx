# Business Intelligence 2.5.0: Clusters, Grafana Checks, and UI Upgrades

We’re thrilled to launch the public preview of Business Intelligence 2.5.0, a release from Volkov Labs that enhances the [Business Intelligence platform](/big/) with:

- **Cluster functionality**, featuring a load balancing page for scheduled alerts.
- Improved **Grafana version compatibility** checks.
- Refined **UI updates** for better usability.
- An updated Business Engine OpenAPI specification.

Explore how these updates streamline alerting and management below.

## Cluster Functionality: Power in Unity

In Business Studio, a **cluster** is a group of Business Engines sharing a token, configuration database, and Grafana instance. Clusters now appear in the sidebar, each with two dedicated pages:

### Load Balancing

- View the number of engines and scheduled alerts in a cluster.
- Review a list of engines, their linked Grafana dashboards, and associated alerts.
- Benefit: Optimize alert distribution for performance across dozens or hundreds of rules.

/>

### Settings

- Edit the cluster name, inspect token details, and monitor connected engines’ versions and statuses.
- Benefit: Centralize cluster oversight for seamless management.

/>

## Enhanced Grafana Version Compatibility

Transparency meets reliability with new Grafana version checks:

- The **Environment page** now displays the connected Grafana version.
- Behind-the-scenes compatibility checks alert you to potential issues.

This ensures Business Intelligence aligns smoothly with your Grafana setup.

## UI Upgrades for Intuition

Business Studio’s interface gets a polish with:

- **Panel Selection:** Now shows panel type in descriptions for easier setup.
- **Threshold Colors:** Updated to match Grafana’s naming conventions.
- **Alert Timing:** “In alerting since” dates sync with alert history for accuracy.

These tweaks make navigation and configuration more intuitive.

## Updated OpenAPI Specification

The Business Engine’s [OpenAPI specification](/big/api/) is refreshed, ensuring third-party integrations stay effortless and current with 2.5.0 features.
