# Business Intelligence 2.3.0: Simplified Start, License Updates, and Code Editing

We’re excited to launch the public preview of Business Intelligence 2.3.0, a release from Volkov Labs that enhances the [Business Intelligence platform](/big/) with:

- Two new **guides** for an easier start.
- **Business Studio** updates:
  - Simplified **license token updates**.
  - Enabled **auto-updates**.
  - Added **Results Sample Size** for alert row limits.
  - Introduced the **Monaco code editor** for action messages.
  - Refined **alert condition overrides**.
- Improved **high-availability and load balancing**.

Dive into the details below to see how these changes streamline your BI workflow.

## Easier Onboarding with Two Guides

New to Business Intelligence? We’ve added two guides to the documentation:

### Quick Start

- The [Quick Start](/big/quick-start/) offers a fast track using minimal steps.
- Requires: Existing Grafana and production database.
- Outcome: Business Studio up and running in minutes.

### Tutorial

Daria’s video walks you through installation, then demonstrates creating and assigning your first alert action to a rule.

## Simplified License Token Updates

Switching from a Community to a Production license is now easier. Instead of tweaking environment variables, use Business Studio:

- Check **Update Engine License** in the settings.
- Paste a new token into the **Token** field and hit **Save**.
- Result: Both Business Studio and Engine licenses update simultaneously.

/>

## Auto-Updates for Business Studio

Business Studio now checks for updates hourly on GitHub (MacOS and Windows). When a new version is available, a dialog prompts you to restart and apply it—keeping you current effortlessly.

## Results Sample Size for Alerts

Control how many alert rows are saved for analysis with the new **Results Sample Size** parameter:

1. Select an engine, go to **Alert Rules**, and pick a rule.
2. On the **Settings** page, under **Evaluation**, choose **All Values** or **Percentage** (not applicable for **Last Value**).
3. Set the sample size in the **Event** section.

This keeps your data manageable without sacrificing insight.

## Monaco Code Editor for Action Messages

Craft alert messages with ease using the [Monaco code editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/), now integrated at the bottom of the action edit window. Features include:

- Handlebars syntax support.
- Code suggestions (triggered by `.` after `event`).
- Auto-formatting.

Preview your message instantly on the **Preview** page.

## Refined Alert Condition Overrides

Alert overrides are now more efficient, with a dedicated table in the [Business Engine database schema](/big/engine/database/) among other performance tweaks. Check the updated schema for details.

## Enhanced High-Availability & Load Balancing

Under-the-hood improvements boost reliability and performance for multi-engine setups handling numerous alerts.
