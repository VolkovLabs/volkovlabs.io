## Revamped OpenAPI Specification

The Business Engineâ€™s [OpenAPI specification](/big/api/) has been completely updated, enabling developers with seamless integrations and access to the latest platform capabilities. Build smarter, faster, and with confidence.

## Master "No Data" Scenarios

Take control of alerts when data is unavailable. Choose from three configurable statuses to align with your workflow needs:

- **Alerting**: Trigger an alert to stay informed.
- **OK**: Mark as resolved to avoid unnecessary notifications.
- **Error**: Flag an issue for immediate attention.

**How to Configure**:

1. Open an alert rule in Business Studio.
2. Go to the **Event** section.
3. Set the **No Data State** parameter.
