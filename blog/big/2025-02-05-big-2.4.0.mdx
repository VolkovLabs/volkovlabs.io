# Business Intelligence 2.4.0: Streamlined Grafana Integration, Alert Insights, and More

We’re excited to announce the public preview of Business Intelligence 2.4.0 from Volkov Labs. This release enhances the [Business Intelligence platform](/big/) with powerful new features designed to simplify workflows and boost efficiency:

- **Effortless Grafana connection** through Business Studio.
- **Detailed alert event insights** for faster troubleshooting.
- **High Availability (HA)** status visibility in Business Engine.
- **Simplified alert scheduling** with intuitive templates.
- **Data frame previews** directly in Business Studio.
- **Improved user prompts** for seamless configuration.
- **Updated Business Engine API** for better integrations.

Read on to explore how these updates can transform your BI experience.

## Connect Grafana Effortlessly with Business Studio

Say goodbye to manual configuration of `GRAFANA_TOKEN` in config files. Business Studio now provides a intuitive interface to connect a Business Engine to your Grafana instance in just a few clicks:

1. Navigate to the Business Engine > **Environment** page.
2. In the **Grafana** section, click **Edit**.
3. Input your Grafana URL and Service Account token.

/>

This updates the `grafana_token` in the `environments` table. For High Availability (HA) setups, updating one engine automatically syncs all others in the same database cluster—no need for repetitive adjustments.

Update a single Business Engine, and the rest of your cluster aligns instantly.

## Gain Deeper Insights into Alert Events

:::info Key Term  
An “alert event” refers to a database record of an [alert](/big/alerting/#alert-components), also known as an alert record.  
:::

### View All Alert Rules at Once

- Head to a Business Engine’s **Overview** page.
- Access the **Alert History** section for a comprehensive view of all alert events.

/>

### Drill Down into a Single Alert Rule

- From the **Alert Rules** page, select a specific rule and explore its **Alert History**.
- Click any event for detailed insights:
  - **Alerting State**: See triggering values in the **Alert Evaluations** section. Use **View as Code** for the complete payload.
  - **Other States**: Review payloads directly within **Alert Evaluations**.

/>

These improvements make troubleshooting alerts faster and more accurate.

## Monitor High Availability (HA) Status

The Business Engine **Overview** page now displays HA status clearly:

- **Disabled**: Indicates a single engine in the cluster.
- **Enabled**: Confirms multiple engines are active.

/>

## Simplify Alert Scheduling

Setting up alert rules is now more accessible with preset scheduling templates alongside traditional Cron expressions. Choose a template and customize it as needed—no deep Cron knowledge required.

## Preview Grafana Data Frames in Business Studio

Inspect the data powering your alerts without leaving Business Studio:

1. Open an alert rule.
2. (Optional) Verify the dashboard and panel in **Alert Settings**.
3. Switch to **Data Preview** and adjust variables if necessary.
4. Examine the data frame—or select **View as Code** for raw output.
5. (Optional) Compare with Grafana’s **Table View** in panel edit mode.

This feature bridges Business Studio and Grafana, offering full transparency into your data.

## Benefit from Clearer User Prompts

We’ve enhanced UI prompts to better explain parameters, minimizing setup errors and making configuration more intuitive.

## Leverage the Updated Business Engine API

The [OpenAPI specification](/big/api/) has been updated to align with 2.4.0’s new capabilities, ensuring seamless third-party integrations.
