# Business Intelligence 2.4.0: Easier Grafana Connect, Alert Insights, and More

We’re thrilled to unveil the public preview of Business Intelligence 2.4.0, a release from Volkov Labs that enhances the [Business Intelligence platform](/big/) with:

- Seamless **Grafana connection** via Business Studio.
- Richer **alert event details** for troubleshooting.
- **High Availability (HA)** status in the Business Engine overview.
- A simplified **scheduler** for alert rules.
- **Data frame previews** within Business Studio.
- Clearer **user prompts** for configuration.
- An updated Business Engine API.

Discover how these updates streamline your BI experience below.

## Connect Grafana via Business Studio

Gone are the days of manually tweaking the `GRAFANA_TOKEN` in config files. Now, Business Studio offers a user-friendly interface to link a Business Engine to a Grafana instance:

1. Go to Business Engine > **Environment** page.
2. Scroll to the **Grafana** section and click **Edit**.
3. Enter the Grafana URL and Service Account token.

/>

This updates the `grafana_token` in the `environments` table. In an HA setup, editing one engine syncs all others connected to the same database—no redundant tweaks needed.

Update one Business Engine, and all others in the cluster follow automatically.

## Deeper Alert Event Insights

:::info Terminology  
An “alert event” is a database record of an [alert](/big/alerting/#alert-components), also called an alert record.  
:::

### All Alert Rules

- Navigate to a Business Engine’s **Overview** page.
- Check the **Alert History** for a unified view of all alert events.

/>

### Single Alert Rule

- Go to the **Alert Rules** page, select a rule, and review its **Alert History**.
- Click an event to dive into details.
  - **Alerting State**: The **Alert Evaluations** section highlights triggering values. Use **View as Code** for the full payload.
  - **Other States**: Payloads display directly in **Alert Evaluations**.

/>

These enhancements make troubleshooting faster and more precise.

## High Availability (HA) Status

The Business Engine **Overview** now flags HA status:

- **Disabled**: Solo engine in the cluster.
- **Enabled**: Multiple engines detected.

## Simplified Alert Scheduling

Creating alert rules is now easier with preset templates alongside Cron expressions. Pick a template and tweak as needed—no Cron expertise required.

## Preview Grafana Data Frames

See the data behind your alerts directly in Business Studio:

1. Open an alert rule.
2. (Optional) Confirm dashboard and panel on **Alert Settings**.
3. Switch to **Data Preview** and adjust variables if needed.
4. Review the data frame—or click **View as Code** for raw details.
5. (Optional) Cross-check in Grafana’s **Table View** under panel edit mode.

This transparency bridges Business Studio and Grafana seamlessly.

## Clearer User Prompts

Enhanced prompts across the UI clarify parameter meanings, reducing setup confusion and boosting confidence.

## Updated Business Engine API

The [OpenAPI specification](/big/api/) is refreshed, keeping third-party integrations smooth and aligned with 2.4.0’s features.
