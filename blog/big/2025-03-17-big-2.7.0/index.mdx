## Updated OpenAPI Specification

The Business Engine’s [OpenAPI specification](/big/api/) is refreshed, ensuring seamless integration for third-party developers and keeping your workflows aligned with the latest capabilities.

## Key Features

### Tailored User Profiles

New business-oriented and technical profiles customize the experience—simplified for decision-makers, detailed for engineers—making BI accessible to all.

Configure user profiles using the icon located in the top right corner. 
Specify a user name, email (which will be used when a user creates a ticket for our support team), and one of the two roles: **Business-oriented** or **Technical**.

/>

When a user creates a ticket for our support team, the Business Studio automatically fills out the name and email. The user needs to write a message and optionally attach files that further outline or better demonstrate the problem/idea.
