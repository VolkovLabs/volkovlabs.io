## Redesigned Alerting Panel

The updated Alerting Panel offers a centralized and user-friendly interface for managing alerts, aligning seamlessly with Grafana’s [alerting basics](/big/alerting/).

### Alert Card Design

Each alert is represented by a modern, compact card that includes:

- The alert title and associated panel name.
- Scheduling information.
- Clear status indicators and actionable buttons.

### Alert Statuses

Alerts are tracked using two distinct status types:

- **Active/Paused**: Indicates whether the alert is running or temporarily disabled.
- **Run State**:
  - **Scheduled**: The alert is queued and has not yet executed.
  - **OK**: No breaches or patterns detected during evaluation.
  - **Alerting**: Thresholds have been breached or a pattern has been matched.
  - **Error**: An issue occurred with the query, annotation, or webhook.

By default, new alerts are set to **Active** and **Scheduled**. Pausing or editing an alert resets its state to **Scheduled**.

### Action Buttons

The Alerting Panel provides four intuitive action buttons for full control:

- **Info**: Displays detailed information about the alert.
- **Pause/Activate**: Toggles the alert between active and paused states.
- **Edit**: Opens the edit drawer for modifications (resets to **Scheduled** upon saving).
- **Delete**: Removes the alert after a confirmation prompt.

## Regex Pattern Evaluation

In addition to **Thresholds**, alerts now support a powerful new **Regex Pattern** evaluation option:

- **Thresholds**: Evaluates data against predefined limits set in the panel.
- **Regex Pattern**: Searches for specific patterns within designated fields (optional).

This feature is accessible in the **Evaluation** category of the alert settings.

## Webhook Enhancements

### Test Connectivity

A new **Test Connectivity** button in the Edit Webhook drawer allows you to verify the functionality of webhook endpoints before deployment.

### Use by Default Option

You can now designate a webhook as the default. When no specific webhook is selected for an alert, the default webhook is automatically applied, ensuring seamless integration.
