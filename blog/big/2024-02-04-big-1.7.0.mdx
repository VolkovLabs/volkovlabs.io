## Distributed High Availability (HA)

High Availability is a top priority for many, and with 1.7.0, we’ve made it a reality. Our BI platform now supports **clustered components**, ensuring redundancy and workload distribution for continuous operation, even under heavy demand. Key clusters include:

- **BI Engine Cluster**: Balances Server API requests and automates alert rule scheduling.
- **Grafana Cluster**: Powers data visualization and serves HTTP API for the BI Engine.
- **Prometheus Cluster**: Stores performance metrics for the BI Engine.
- **PostgreSQL Cluster**: Manages BI Engine data, Grafana configurations, and production datasets.

See the HA architecture in action:

## Swagger REST API

Unlock new possibilities with our **Swagger REST API**. Whether you’re automating configurations or accessing critical data, this API simplifies integration and boosts efficiency. Explore the full capabilities in our [REST API documentation](/big/api/).

## UI Enhancements for a Smoother Experience

We’ve fine-tuned the user interface to save you time and reduce friction. Here’s what’s improved:

### Duplicate Alert Button

Need to replicate an alert? The new **Duplicate** button lets you clone existing alerts with a single click, making setup faster and easier.

### Persistent Dashboard Refresh

Say goodbye to workflow interruptions. The add/edit alert drawer now remains open during dashboard refreshes, even with short refresh intervals of 2-3 minutes.

### Enhanced CRON Validation

Scheduling alerts is now more intuitive. Enter an invalid CRON format, and you’ll get immediate feedback with a clear error message—no more trial and error.

### Custom Variable Values

While we natively support SQL and Prometheus data sources, we’re expanding compatibility. For unsupported sources, you can now manually input variable values in the add/edit drawer, ensuring your alerts remain operational.
