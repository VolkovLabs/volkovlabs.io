## Revamped OpenAPI Specification

The Business Engineâ€™s [OpenAPI specification](/big/api/) got a major refresh, paving the way for effortless developer integrations and keeping your tools in sync with the latest capabilities.

## Whatâ€™s New in 3.0.0

### Handle "No Data" Like a Pro

New configuration options let you decide how alerts behave when dataâ€™s missingâ€”customize it to fit your needs without breaking a sweat.

If no data is returned, specify what [status](/big/alerting/manage-alert-rules/#flow-schema) the alert should change into. The choices are:

- **Alerting**,
- **OK**,
- **Error**.

To access:

1.  Open any alert rule configuration.
2.  Scroll down to the **Event** section and configure the **No data state** parameter.

  width="100%"
/>

### Crystal-Clear Action Previews

The revamped action configuration preview shows exactly whatâ€™s happening, making it easier to fine-tune your setup with confidence.

When you alter the action message template, it is often uncertain what the actual message will look like in all scenarios. The **Preview** section allows you to see that actual message using the messages from the action history.

### Navigate with Ease

A back button and breadcrumb trails keep you oriented, letting you zip through configurations without losing your place. This design saves a lot of screen real estate for a better user experience.

### Clean History, Lean System

An automated cleanup process for alert and action event history keeps your system tidy and efficient, no manual fuss required.

### Flexible Alerting Control

Disable alerting within condition overrides for ultimate flexibility, tailoring notifications to exactly when and where you need them.

For instance, you know that a particular device is out of order and will be fixed in a month. To avoid receiving unnecessary alerts and to keep the setting, instead of removing it, you can temporarily disable it.

### Streamlined Alert Rules

Say goodbye to clutterâ€”removing the default action makes setting up alert rules faster and more intuitive, putting you in full control from the start.

### Polished UI Experience

From sharper messages to optimized layouts, every interaction feels smootherâ€”because your time deserves a great experience.

### Expanded test coverage

Extensive test coverage to ensure better performance and an uninterrupted user experience.
