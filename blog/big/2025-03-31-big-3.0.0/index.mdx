The Business Engineâ€™s [OpenAPI specification](/big/api/) has been overhauled, enabling seamless integrations and ensuring developers can leverage the latest platform capabilities effortlessly.

## Whatâ€™s New in 3.0.0

### Master "No Data" Scenarios

Easily configure how alerts respond when data is unavailable. Choose from three statuses to suit your workflow:

- **Alerting**: Trigger an alert.
- **OK**: Mark as resolved.
- **Error**: Flag an issue.

**How to configure**:

1. Open an alert rule in the Business Studio.
2. Navigate to the **Event** section.
3. Set the **No data state** parameter.
