# Business Intelligence 2.5.0: Clusters, Grafana Checks, and UI Enhancements

We’re excited to announce the public preview of Business Intelligence 2.5.0, a significant update from Volkov Labs that elevates the [Business Intelligence platform](/big/) with powerful new features and improvements:

- **Cluster functionality** with a dedicated load balancing page for scheduled alerts.
- Enhanced **Grafana version compatibility** checks for seamless integration.
- Intuitive **UI enhancements** for a smoother user experience.
- An updated **Business Engine OpenAPI specification** for better integrations.

Dive into the details below to see how these updates can transform your alerting and management workflows.

## Cluster Functionality: Strength in Collaboration

In Business Studio, a **cluster** refers to a group of Business Engines that share a common token, configuration database, and Grafana instance. This release introduces clusters in the sidebar, each accompanied by two dedicated pages for streamlined management:

### Load Balancing

- Monitor the number of engines and scheduled alerts within a cluster.
- Access a detailed list of engines, their associated Grafana dashboards, and linked alerts.
- **Benefit:** Efficiently distribute alerts across dozens or hundreds of rules to optimize performance.

### Settings

- Update cluster names, review token information, and track the version and status of connected engines.
- **Benefit:** Gain centralized control and visibility for effortless cluster management.

## Improved Grafana Version Compatibility

This release prioritizes transparency and reliability with enhanced Grafana compatibility features:

- The **Environment page** now clearly displays the connected Grafana version.
- Automated compatibility checks proactively identify potential issues in the background.

These updates ensure that Business Intelligence integrates seamlessly with your Grafana environment.

## UI Enhancements for Seamless Navigation

Business Studio’s user interface has been refined for greater clarity and ease of use:

- **Panel Selection:** Panel descriptions now include type information for simpler configuration.
- **Threshold Colors:** Color naming conventions are updated to align with Grafana’s standards.
- **Alert Timing:** The “In alerting since” timestamp now matches alert history for improved accuracy.

These thoughtful updates make setup and navigation more intuitive than ever.

## Updated OpenAPI Specification

The Business Engine’s [OpenAPI specification](/big/api/) has been revised to reflect the latest 2.5.0 features, ensuring smooth and up-to-date third-party integrations.
