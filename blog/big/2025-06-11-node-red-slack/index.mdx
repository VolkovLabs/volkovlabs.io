### Key Benefits for Business Intelligence

- **Dynamic Visuals**: Generate images tailored to specific alert conditions using real-time data and dashboard variables.
- **Rich Context**: Include Grafana panel screenshots in notifications for a visual snapshot of critical issues, such as high latency or sales performance drops.
- **Seamless Integration**: Pair with Node-RED workflows to deliver rendered images to Slack or other communication platforms effortlessly.

This feature ensures that alerts are not just text-based but provide immediate visual insights, enabling teams to assess and act on BI events faster.

## Node-RED Workflow for BI Alerting: A Closer Look

We’ve designed a Node-RED flow to process BI alerts from our platform, leverage the Image Render Microservice for visual content, and send formatted notifications to Slack. This workflow supports two scenarios:

1. **Text-Only Alerts**: For quick updates on BI metrics.
2. **Image-Enhanced Alerts**: For detailed context with rendered visuals, such as Grafana panel screenshots.

The flow accepts HTTP POST requests, processes payloads with dashboard variables, and incorporates error handling and debugging for reliability in BI environments.

  src="/img/blog/2025-06-11-node-red-slack/workflow.png"
  alt="Node-RED workflow designed for BI alerting with Slack integration"
/>

### Key Features of the Workflow

- **HTTP Endpoint**: Listens for BI event notifications at `/slack`.
- **Payload Processing**: Extracts Slack channel ID, message text, and image data (rendered via dashboard variables) from incoming requests.
- **Conditional Logic**: Routes alerts based on whether a rendered image is included.
- **Slack API Integration**: Sends messages and images using Slack’s APIs (`chat.postMessage`, `files.getUploadURLExternal`, etc.).
- **Error Handling**: Ensures robustness with built-in error-catching mechanisms.
- **Debugging**: Includes debug nodes for troubleshooting and optimizing BI workflows.

## Breaking Down the Node-RED Workflow

Let’s explore the key components of this Node-RED flow and how it integrates with the Image Render Microservice to enhance BI alerting.

### Triggering the Flow

The workflow starts with an **HTTP In** node (`Slack Trigger /slack`) that receives POST requests from the Business Intelligence Platform. These requests carry event data, including dashboard variables for channel ID, message text, and image references.

- **Input**: HTTP POST request with JSON payload.
- **Output**: Routes data to debug nodes (`Show Payload`, `Show Headers`) and a processing node (`Prepare Payload`).

  alt="Node-RED workflow segment from trigger to image check switch"
/>

### Preparing the Payload with Dashboard Variables

The **Prepare Payload** function node formats the incoming BI alert data, including:

- Slack channel ID from request headers.
- Alert message text.
- Image data (if available), such as a Base64-encoded screenshot rendered by the Image Render Microservice.

```javascript
/**
 * Panel Screenshot via Image Render Microservice
 */
let image = msg.payload.event.condition?.panelScreenshot || "";
let title = msg.payload.event.alert?.title || "BI Metric Snapshot";

/**
 * Payload with Dashboard Variables
 */
msg.payload = {
  channel_id: msg.req.headers.channel_id,
  text: msg.payload.message,
  title,
  image,
};

return msg;
```

### Routing Based on Image Availability

The **Check Image** switch node evaluates `msg.payload.image` to determine the next steps:

- **Image Present**: Routes to nodes for uploading the rendered image to Slack.
- **No Image**: Routes to nodes for sending a text-only BI notification.

### Sending Text-Only Alerts

For text-only alerts, the **Set Message** function node formats the payload for Slack’s `chat.postMessage` API, including the channel ID and message text. Responses are handled with appropriate HTTP status codes (200 for success, 400 for failure).

```javascript
/**
 * Payload for BI Text Alert
 */
msg.payload = {
  channel: msg.payload.channel_id,
  text: msg.payload.text,
};

return msg;
```

  alt="Action settings using Handlebars with a preview in Business Studio"
/>

### Uploading Rendered Images to Slack

For alerts with images, the workflow processes the rendered content through multiple steps:

1. **Set Upload URL Payload**: Converts Base64-encoded image data to a Buffer and prepares metadata like filename and type.
2. **Get Upload URL**: Retrieves a temporary upload URL from Slack’s `files.getUploadURLExternal` API.
3. **Set Upload File Payload**: Formats the upload request.
4. **Upload File to URL**: Sends the image data to Slack.
5. **Complete Upload**: Finalizes the upload and shares the image in the Slack channel with an accompanying message.

  src="/img/blog/2025-06-11-node-red-slack/upload-workflow.png"
  alt="Node-RED workflow segment for uploading rendered images to Slack"
/>

### Error Handling and Debugging

A **Catch** node (`Error Catch`) captures errors in the workflow, routing them to an error response node (`Error Response`) with a 400 status code.

Debug nodes throughout the flow help monitor payloads and API responses, ensuring smooth operation for BI alerting.

### Testing the Workflow

Inject nodes (`Send Message`, `Send Image`) enable testing of text and image-based alerts without triggering real events, simplifying development and validation.
