We are excited to announce the public preview release of the Business Intelligence platform 2.2.0. This release marks a significant milestone in Volkov Labs' mission to revolutionize Business Insights through high-performance, scalable, and alert-driven analytics. It includes the following updates:

- Business Studio developed using a tech stack based on Electron and Tailwind UI.
  - Allows to add and delete Business Engines connected to Grafana instances.
  - Allows to add, update and delete alert rules and alerts actions.
  - Supports for Light and Dark themes.
  - Provides installers for MacOS, Linux and Windows with auto update functionality for MacOS and Windows.
- Supports major Grafana 11 HTTP API.
- Added default values for environment variables to make them optional.

## Business Studio

The Business Studio is an application developed by Volkov Labs. It plays the role of the control center for the Business Intelligence platform, providing a user-friendly interface and keeping all necessary configurations in one place.

You start by connecting to as many Business Engines as needed, where each one is connected to a Grafana instance. From there, an authorized user can create and manage alert rules and actions.

/>

The detailed documentation is coming in the beginning of 2025. Follow our [blog](/blog/) updates to be the first one to know when we publish it.

### Add and delete Business Engines

This feature allows to add as many Business Engines as needed to be in your system. Each of them should already be connected to a Grafana Instance. In the future, you can manage that connection from the Business Studio as well.

To add a new Business Engine, click the **+ Add** button on the main screen and then specify the following:

1. Engine name. It should be a unique name within the Business Studio.
2. Engine URL. A URL for this Business Engine.
3. Token.

If you need a token for more than 10 Business Alerts, use the **Support** menu at the bottom left to request it.

<Image

  src="/img/blog/2024-12-31-big-2.2.0/new-engine.png"
/>

:::info Subscription
Business Intelligence is offered as a subscription-based product, and there is also a Community version available.

Community version is limited to 10 Business Alerts and a single cluster of Business Engines.
:::

Once the Business Engine is added, you can review the available alert history, engine configuration, and actions by clicking on its name in the list.

<Image
  title="Business Engine Overview page with Alert History."
  src="/img/blog/2024-12-31-big-2.2.0/engine-overview.png"
/>

The Business Engine configuration has 5 tabs:

- Overview,
- Alert rules,
- Actions,
- Environment,
- Settings.

### Manage alert rules

Use the **Alert rules** tab to manage alert rules. Here you can:

1. Add a new alert rule.
2. Review the alert rule running states for each existing alert rule. There are two possible states:

- **Active**,
- **Paused**.

3. Review the alert rule alerting state for each existing alert rule. There are five possible statuses:

- **Scheduled**,
- **OK**,
- **Alerting**,
- **Error**.

4. Pause/Start the alert rule.
5. Delete the alert rule.

<Image
  title="Use the Alert Rules tab to manage alert rules."
  src="/img/blog/2024-12-31-big-2.2.0/tab-alert-rules.png"
/>

In the future, the **Alert Rule** tab will provide an interface to work with hundreds of alert rules by allowing grouping, filtering, etc., to ensure easy navigation and control.

Below is a logical schema of alert rules statuses.

<Image
  title="A logical schema of alert rules statuses."
  src="/img/blog/2024-12-31-big-2.2.0/alert-statuses.png"
  width="50%"
/>

The **Add a new rule** window looks as follows:

<Image
  title="The Add a new rule window."
  src="/img/blog/2024-12-31-big-2.2.0/new-rule.png"
/>

The new alert rule/edit window has the following configuration elements to specify:

- **Title** is an alert name.
- **Schedule** is a frequency of how often the rule should run. With CRON expressions your schedule can be as complex as needed.
- **Target Dashboard** and **Target Panel** are drop-downs to select from the existing ones. The alert rule will take queries and thresholds from there automatically.
- **Time Range** could be either taken from the dashboard or specified custom.
- The alert **evaluation** could be set to **Thresholds** or **Regex Pattern**.
  - For the **Thresholds**, the alert examines the data against thresholds set in the panel options.
  - For the **Regex Pattern**, the alert examines the specified fields (optional) and searches the specified pattern.
- For the alert **action**, select from the drop-down list of the existing, pre-configured action APIs.
- **Add Annotation** option.
  - specify **Panel** to create and attach an annotation to a panel,
  - specify **Dashboard** to create and attach an annotation to a dashboard (i.e. all panels of this dashboard),
  - specify **Disabled** to disable the creation of any annotation following the triggered alert rule.

### Manage alert actions

Use the **Actions** tab to manage alert actions. Here you can:

1. Add a new alert action.
2. Delete an existing alert action.
3. There must be at least one alert action configured. That is the reason why there has to be a **default** alert action without a trash can icon (not possible to delete).

<Image
  title="The Actions tab to manage alert actions."
  src="/img/blog/2024-12-31-big-2.2.0/tab-actions.png"
/>

The **Add a new action** window looks as follows:

<Image
  title="The Add a new action window."
  src="/img/blog/2024-12-31-big-2.2.0/new-action.png"
/>

The new alert action/edit mode has the following configuration elements to specify:

- **Title** is an action name,
- **Type** (HTTP or Logs),
- **HTTP Request URL** and request **method**. You can add **Headers** (additional information) to a request if needed,
- **Message** template customizable using Handlebars.

You can use the **Test Connectivity** button to check REST API endpoint availability.

### Supports for Light and Dark themes

The Business Studio follows system visual appearance preferences by supporting Light and Dark color themes.

<Image
  title="The Business Studio supports Light and Dark color themes."
  src="/img/blog/2024-12-31-big-2.2.0/theme.png"
/>

## Business Studio installers

We ensured the installation could be done in one click for MacOS, Linux, and Windows. For MacOS and Windows, you can configure the auto-update functionality to stay up-to-date with the latest release features.

### Changelog

To help users follow the new features, we provide access to the **Change log** at the bottom left corner.

<Image
  title="Changelog menu in the Business Studio."
  src="/img/blog/2024-12-31-big-2.2.0/changelog.png"
/>

## Support of major Grafana 11 HTTP API

The Business Studio works with Grafana starting from version 11. It might work with Grafana 10.X, but we did not extensively test that compatibility. Use at your own risk.

The Business Intelligence platform will always be compatible with the current Grafana version.

## Default values for environment variables

To simplify the initial Business Engine setup, we configured many of the environment variables by giving them default values.

There are only 7 environment variables that must be set during the installation:

- Timescale database connection details.
- Grafana URL and Token (Service Account).

<Code
  url="https://github.com/VolkovLabs/business-intelligence/blob/main/.env"
  language="shell"
/>

## Added Engine API to get environment info

All environment variables are displayed on the **Environment** tab. In the future, we plan to allow them to be modified. The environment info is taken by using the [GET /environment endpoint](/big/api/).

<Image
  title="Environment variables for the Charlie Engine 1."
  src="/img/blog/2024-12-31-big-2.2.0/env.png"
/>

## Added Engine API to get timeline of alert statuses

The timeline of alerting states is a subset of all alert rule records and includes only instances where alerting state changes. We added Engine API endpoint to [get timeline of alerting states](/big/api/).

For instance, below is the complete list of alert rule states.

```text
date                      Previous            New
1/1/25, 10:29:01 AM       OK                  Alerting
1/1/25, 10:28:01 AM       OK                  OK
1/1/25, 10:27:01 AM       OK                  OK
1/1/25, 10:26:01 AM       OK                  OK
1/1/25, 10:25:01 AM       OK                  OK
1/1/25, 10:24:01 AM       OK                  OK
```

And here is the timeline. It consists of only the records where the alerting state changes.

```text
date                      Previous            New
1/1/25, 10:29:01 AM       OK                  Alerting
```
