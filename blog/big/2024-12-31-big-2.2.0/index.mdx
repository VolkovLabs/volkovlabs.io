We’re thrilled to unveil the public preview of Business Intelligence 2.2.0, a milestone release from Volkov Labs advancing our mission to transform Business Insights with scalable, alert-driven analytics. Key updates include:

Explore how these enhancements elevate your BI experience below.

## Business Studio: Your BI Command Center

Business Studio, crafted by Volkov Labs, centralizes control of the Business Intelligence platform with an intuitive interface. Connect multiple Business Engines—each tied to a Grafana instance—and manage alert rules and actions effortlessly.

### Add and Delete Business Engines

- Add engines via the **+ Add** button on the main screen:
  1. Enter a unique **Engine Name**.
  2. Provide the **Engine URL**.
  3. Input a **Token**.
- Need a token for over 10 alerts? Request one via the **Support** menu.

:::info Subscription

Once added, click an engine to access its **Overview**, **Alert Rules**, **Actions**, **Environment**, and **Settings** pages.

### Manage Alert Rules

The **Alert Rules** page lets you:

- Add new rules.
- Toggle between **Active** and **Paused** states.
- Monitor statuses: **Scheduled**, **OK**, **Alerting**, **Error**.
- Pause/start or delete rules.

<Image
  title="Manage alert rules with ease."
  src="/img/blog/2024-12-31-big-2.2.0/tab-alert-rules.png"
/>

Future updates will add grouping and filtering for handling hundreds of rules. See the status flow:

  src="/img/blog/2024-12-31-big-2.2.0/alert-statuses.png"
  width="50%"
/>

The **Add a New Rule** window includes:

- **Title**: Rule name.
- **Schedule**: CRON-based frequency.
- **Target Dashboard/Panel**: Auto-pulls queries and thresholds.
- **Time Range**: Dashboard-default or custom.
- **Evaluation**: **Thresholds** (panel-based) or **Regex Pattern** (field/pattern search).
- **Action**: Select from pre-configured APIs.
- **Annotation**: Attach to **Panel**, **Dashboard**, or **Disabled**.

### Manage Alert Actions

The **Actions** page allows:

- Adding new actions.
- Deleting actions (except the non-deletable **default** action).

<Image
  title="Configure alert actions."
  src="/img/blog/2024-12-31-big-2.2.0/tab-actions.png"
/>

The **Add a New Action** window offers:

- **Title**: Action name.
- **Type**: HTTP or Logs.
- **HTTP Details**: URL, method, optional headers.
- **Message**: Handlebars-customizable template.
- **Test Connectivity**: Verify API endpoint.

### Light and Dark Themes

Business Studio adapts to your system’s Light or Dark theme preferences for a seamless look.

### Installers and Auto-Updates

One-click installers are available for MacOS, Linux, and Windows, with auto-updates for MacOS and Windows. Track changes via the **Changelog** in the bottom-left corner.

## Grafana 11 HTTP API Support

Business Studio aligns with Grafana 11’s HTTP API (version 10.x may work but isn’t fully tested—use cautiously). We’ll keep pace with future Grafana releases.

## Simplified Environment Variables

Setup is easier with default values for most environment variables. Only these seven are required:

- Timescale database connection details.
- Grafana URL and Token (Service Account).

<Code
  url="https://github.com/VolkovLabs/business-intelligence/blob/main/.env"
  language="shell"
/>

## New Engine APIs

### Environment Info

View all environment variables on the **Environment** page via the [GET /environment endpoint](/big/api/). Editing is planned for future releases.

  src="/img/blog/2024-12-31-big-2.2.0/env.png"
/>

### Alert Status Timeline

The [GET timeline endpoint](/big/api/) returns a concise history of alert state changes, filtering out redundant records.

For instance, below is the complete list of alert rule states.

```csv
date                      Previous            New
1/1/25, 10:29:01 AM       OK                  Alerting
1/1/25, 10:28:01 AM       OK                  OK
1/1/25, 10:27:01 AM       OK                  OK
1/1/25, 10:26:01 AM       OK                  OK
1/1/25, 10:25:01 AM       OK                  OK
1/1/25, 10:24:01 AM       OK                  OK
```

And here is the timeline. It consists of only the records where the alerting state changes.

```csv
date                      Previous            New
1/1/25, 10:29:01 AM       OK                  Alerting
```
