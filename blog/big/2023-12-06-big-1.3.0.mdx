# Business Intelligence 1.3.0: Transformations, Thresholds, and Health Checks

We are thrilled to announce the release of **Business Intelligence 1.3.0**, a proof-of-concept update from Volkov Labs that sets the stage for significant advancements in our [Business Intelligence platform](/big/). This release introduces powerful new features and enhancements, including:

- **User role support** in the Alerting panel for tailored access control.
- **Threshold color integration** to visually define alert ranges.
- Beta support for **transformations and multi-frame data sets**.
- Improved **Grafana health checks** with configurable retry and timeout options.

Watch the highlights of this release in action:

## User Role Support in the Alerting Panel

The Alerting panel now aligns with Grafana's user roles, ensuring that access to specific actions is appropriately restricted based on a user's permissions. This enhances security and usability across different user types.

### Alert Rules Page Permissions

- **Admins/Editors**: Full control with access to **Info**, **Pause/Resume**, **Edit**, and **Delete** actions.
- **Viewers**: Restricted access, limited to **Info** and **Pause/Resume** actions.

### Webhooks Page Permissions

- **Admins/Editors**: Complete access to **Test**, **Edit**, and **Delete** actions.
- **Viewers**: Limited to the **Test** action only.

:::info Note
A greyed-out **Delete** button indicates that the webhook is associated with an active alert rule and cannot be deleted until the association is removed.

## Threshold Colors for Alert Triggers

With Business Intelligence 1.3.0, the BI Engine leverages **Threshold Colors** to define acceptable data ranges visually. Alerts are triggered when values fall outside these ranges, allowing teams to focus on critical deviations while ignoring normal fluctuations.

**Example Scenario (Allowable Range: 50-80):**

- **Alert 1**: Triggered when the temperature drops below 40.
- **Alert 2**: Triggered with a spike to 94.7, followed by a drop to 20.4.
- **Alert 3**: Triggered at a high of 93.4, then a low of 21.1.

Annotations (highlighted in light blue) visually mark these events on the dashboard. Gaps in annotations represent sudden data shifts, while continuous breaches extend the annotation duration as alerts are evaluated periodically.

## Beta Support for Transformations and Multi-Frame Data Sets

This release introduces beta support for advanced data handling, enabling more flexible and powerful alert configurations tied to specific dashboards and panels.

### Multi-Frame Data Support

Business Intelligence 1.3.0 now supports multi-frame data sets, allowing alerts to monitor multiple data frames from a single source. For instance, when monitoring three devices:

- An alert is triggered if **any device** (e.g., Device 2) exceeds the defined range.
- The alert resolves only when the **last device** (e.g., Device 3) returns to the normal range.

### Transformations (Beta)

Grafana transformations are now supported in beta. While most transformations should function as expected, the wide variety of options in Grafana means some may require additional refinement. We are actively working on full compatibility and will provide updates in future releases.

:::info Beta Status
Transformation support is still evolving due to the extensive range of Grafana transformation options. We appreciate your feedback during this beta phase.

## Enhanced Grafana Health Check Options

The BI Engine depends on Grafana for its operations, but differences in startup timing can sometimes cause health check failures, leading to unexpected shutdowns. To address this, Business Intelligence 1.3.0 introduces configurable **retry** and **timeout** parameters for Grafana health checks. By default, the system waits up to 5 seconds, but these settings can be customized to suit your environment.

Below is an example configuration for health check parameters:

```sh
##
## Service Account
## - Viewer permission is required to access dashboards.
## - Editor permission is required to access dashboards and add annotations.
##
GRAFANA_TOKEN=SERVICE-ACCOUNT-TOKEN

##
## Grafana HTTP API
##
GRAFANA_URL=http://grafana:3000

##
## Grafana Health Check Timeout (in milliseconds)
## Total wait time for Grafana availability is calculated as (Timeout * Number of Retries / 1000) seconds.
##
GRAFANA_HEALTH_CHECK_TIMEOUT=1000

##
## Grafana Health Check Number of Retries
##
GRAFANA_HEALTH_CHECK_RETRY=5
```
