## Feature Highlights

### Scheduled Dashboard Screenshots: Automate Reporting Workflows

Say goodbye to manual dashboard captures. With **Scheduled Dashboard Screenshots**, you can now automate the process of taking snapshots of your dashboards at predefined intervals. This feature integrates seamlessly with automated actions, enabling streamlined reporting workflows.

Whether you’re sharing updates with stakeholders or archiving data for compliance, this tool saves time and ensures consistency.

- **Key Benefit:** Automate repetitive tasks and focus on insights rather than manual processes.
- **Use Case:** Schedule daily screenshots of critical dashboards for executive summaries or audits.

### Optimized Rendering Performance: Speed with GPU Support

Rendering complex dashboards just got faster. Business Intelligence 3.6.0 introduces **GPU-supported rendering** and intelligent logic to wait for full page loads before capturing data. The result? A **2x performance boost** in rendering speed, allowing you to access insights quicker than ever.

- **Key Benefit:** Faster rendering means quicker decision-making.
- **Use Case:** Render large, data-heavy dashboards without delays during peak analysis periods.

### Alert State Transition: Clarity in Critical Moments

Managing alerts is now more intuitive with **Alert State Transition**. This feature groups related events together, providing better clarity and context during critical incidents. Instead of sifting through isolated notifications, you’ll see a cohesive picture of alert states, making it easier to respond effectively.

- **Key Benefit:** Improved visibility into alert progression and resolution.
- **Use Case:** Track the lifecycle of an alert during system outages for faster troubleshooting.

### Refined Alerting Logic: Smarter Notifications

We’ve fine-tuned our alerting system to be smarter. With **Refined Alerting Logic**, Business Intelligence 3.6.0 ignores "No Data" states when disabled, ensuring you only receive notifications that matter. This reduces noise and helps you focus on actionable insights.

- **Key Benefit:** Fewer false positives for a more focused alerting experience.
- **Use Case:** Avoid unnecessary alerts during maintenance windows or data gaps.

### Action Template Updates: Tailored Flexibility

Customization is key to effective workflows. The updated **Action Templates** in 3.6.0 offer enhanced support for separate templates in Alerting and Reporting workflows. This allows for more granular control and tailored configurations to suit your specific needs.

- **Key Benefit:** Create workflows that align perfectly with your operational goals.
- **Use Case:** Design distinct alerting templates for different teams or reporting schedules.

### UI and Accessibility Improvements: A Polished Experience

We’ve refreshed the user interface with subtle yet impactful changes. **UI and Accessibility Improvements** include new loading states (Shimmer effects), refined navigation, and design updates that enhance performance and accessibility. These changes ensure a seamless experience for all users, regardless of ability or device.

- **Key Benefit:** A more intuitive and inclusive platform for every user.
- **Use Case:** Navigate dashboards effortlessly during high-pressure monitoring scenarios.

### Enhanced Firestore Security Rules: Robust Data Protection

Data security remains a top priority. With **Enhanced Firestore Security Rules**, Business Intelligence 3.6.0 introduces stricter controls and improved safety measures across organizations. These updates provide better protection for your data while maintaining ease of access for authorized users.

- **Key Benefit:** Safeguard sensitive information with confidence.
- **Use Case:** Ensure compliance with organizational data policies in multi-team environments.

### Comprehensive E2E Testing: Unmatched Reliability

Reliability is at the core of this release. We’ve implemented **Comprehensive End-to-End (E2E) Testing** to validate Alerting, Reporting, and Actions workflows. This rigorous testing ensures that every feature works as intended, delivering a stable and dependable platform.

- **Key Benefit:** Trust in a platform that’s been thoroughly tested for real-world scenarios.
- **Use Case:** Deploy updates with confidence, knowing critical workflows are validated.
