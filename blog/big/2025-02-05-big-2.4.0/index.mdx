# Streamlined connection to Grafana, improved alert details, simplified scheduler, and more in Business Intelligence 2.4.0

We are excited to announce the public preview release of the Business Intelligence platform 2.4.0. It includes the following updates:

- Possibility to connect a Business Engine to Grafana instance via Business Studio.
- Improved the alert event details for better troubleshooting.
- Added high availability (HA) state in the Business Engine overview.
- Simplified schedule entry for creating alert rules.
- Added Grafana data frames review in the Business Studio.
- Enhanced user prompts to improve configuration clarity.
- Updated Business Engine API documentation.

## Connect a Business Engine to Grafana instance via Business Studio

Previously, the connection between the Business Engine and the Grafana instance had to be made manually, updating the `GRAFANA_TOKEN` environment variable in the configuration file.

Starting from this release, the Business Studio allows you to establish that connection in the comfort of a user-friendly interface.

To accomplish that, follow the steps:

1. Open Business Engine -> **Environment** page.
2. Scroll to the **Grafana** section.
3. Click the **Edit** button.
4. Provide Grafana instance URL.
5. Provide Service account token.

/>

With this user action, the `grafana_token` column of the `environments` table is updated. That means if multiple business engines are connected to the same Grafana instance (HA scenario), then with updating the settings only for one business engine, all others are automatically updated since they all point to the same database field.

:::info High Availability

If multiple Business Engines are connected to the same Grafana instance, then updating ONLY one Business Engine is required. The rest of the connected business engines will be updated automatically.

## Improved the alert event details

:::info terminology
An alert event is an alternative term for an [alert record](/big/alerting/#alert-components). Technically, it is a record in a database about the alert event.
:::

### All alert rules

1.  Open a Business Engine of your interest.
2.  Open the **Overview** page.
3.  Review the **Alert history** of all alert records generated for the selected Business Engine.

<Image
  title="Review all alert rules events in one listing."
  src="/img/blog/2025-02-05-big-2.4.0/all-alerts.png"
/>

### One alert rule

1.  Open a Business Engine of your interest.
2.  Open the **Alert rules** page.
3.  Click on the alert rule of interest.
4.  Review the **Alert history** of the selected alert rule.

<Image
  title="Review one alert rule event history."
  src="/img/blog/2025-02-05-big-2.4.0/one-alert.png"
/>

You can click on any alert record to review details. If the latest alert state (**New state**) is **Alerting**, the **Alert evaluations** section shows the values that triggered the alert action.

You can always review the payload by clicking on the **View as code** button.

  src="/img/blog/2025-02-05-big-2.4.0/alerting-state.png"
/>

In the case of any other alert state (**New state**), the alert rule payload is displayed right away.

/>

## High availability (HA) state in the Business Engine overview

High availability can be:

- **Disabled**. If a Business Engine is the only one in the cluster.
- **Enabled**. If there are multiple (more than one) Business Engines in the cluster.

/>

## Simplified schedule entry for creating alert rules

In addition to a Cron expression, for simplicity, you can choose one of the easy-to-use templates and then adjust if needed.

## Review Grafana data frames in the Business Studio

To make the interaction between the Business Engine and Grafana more transparent, the Business Studio displays the Grafana data frames participating in the alert rule evaluation.

To review the Grafana data frame in the Business Studio:

1.  Open the alert rule of interest.
2.  Optionally, on the **Alert settings** page confirm the alert rule is assigned to the dashboard(2.1) and panel(2.2) of interest.
3.  Open the **Data preview** page.
4.  Optionally, verify the dashboard variable (data frame filter) is set up to the necessary value.
5.  Review the Grafana data frame in the Business Studio.
6.  Optionally, review the same data frame in Grafana. Open the panel in the Edit mode and switch to the **Table view**.

- Verify the dashboard variable (data frame filter) is set up to the necessary value.
- Review the data frame in Grafana.

  title="Data preview page to review Grafana data frames in the Business Studio."
  src="/img/blog/2025-02-05-big-2.4.0/data-preview.png"
/>

A Grafana data frame can be reviewed as a code by clicking on the **View as code** button.

## Enchanced user prompts to improve configuration clarity

This is done throughout the Business Studio UI to eliminate ambiguity and uncertainty about the parameters' meaning.

## Updated Business Engine API documentation

We maintain the ease of the 3rd party Business Engine integration by timely updating the [OpenAPI specification](/big/api/).
