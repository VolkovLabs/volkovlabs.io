## Alerting page

The **Alerting** page displays all cluster alerts combined. It is convenient when you work with multiple clusters and need to review all alert states simultaneously.

We plan to add filtering and sorting features in the upcoming releases for better analysis.

## Action history page

The **Action history** page overviews all submitted messages triggered by the selected alert action.

1. Select Business Engine, then the **Actions** tab, followed by the specific alert action.
2. Select the **Action history** page.
3. If a message includes a variable, the Business Studio displays the specific variable value that was submitted.

## Data frame fields on the alert event details page

For the alerts in the **Alerting** state, we display column headers for a more intuitive visual representation.

## Grafana transformation compatibility

We work diligently to ensure Business Intelligence compatibility with all Grafana transformations.
However, there are some nuances worth pointing out.

Most existing transformations are part of the core Grafana, written following the general transformation concept. These are always compatible with the Business Intelligence.

Yet, some of the Grafana transformations are created for specific data sources or particular data scenarios. These are outside the general transformation approach, so there could be some hiccups while working with them.

:::info transformations compatibilities

Due to their unique implementation, some rare and specific Grafana transformations might not work correctly. Contact us if you encounter one, and we will find a solution

:::

## Size of the Business Engine's docker image

Though this change is not immediately visible to end-users, it is essential to mention it since it transforms our internal build process, allowing for more efficient development, testing, and deployment.

## Updated Business Engine OpenAPI specification

We maintain the ease of the 3rd party Business Engine integration by timely updating the [OpenAPI specification](/big/api/).
