## Alerting Page: Unified Cluster Insights

The new **Alerting page** consolidates alerts from all clusters into a single view—ideal for managing multiple [high availability clusters](/big/studio/manage-clusters/) at once. Whether you’re tracking dozens or hundreds of alerts, this page offers a clear snapshot of their states.

Filtering and sorting are on the horizon for future releases to deepen your analysis.

## Action History Page: Track Every Message

The **Action History page** provides a detailed log of messages triggered by alert actions. Here’s how to access it:

1. Select a Business Engine, navigate to the **Actions** tab, and pick an alert action.
2. Switch to the **Action History** page.
3. View submitted messages, including resolved variable values where applicable.

This transparency ensures you never miss a notification’s journey.

## Event Details: Data Frame Fields in Focus

For alerts in the **Alerting** state, the **Event Details** page now displays data frame column headers. This visual upgrade makes it easier to interpret alert data at a glance, enhancing troubleshooting and decision-making.

## Grafana Transformation Compatibility

Business Intelligence 2.6.0 aligns with Grafana 11.5.2 transformations, ensuring broad compatibility. Most core Grafana transformations—built on a general framework—work seamlessly. However, some niche transformations, tailored to specific data sources or scenarios, may deviate from this standard and could encounter issues.

## Leaner Business Engine Docker Image

We’ve optimized the build process, shrinking the Business Engine’s Docker image size. This behind-the-scenes improvement boosts efficiency in development, testing, and deployment, paving the way for faster iterations.

## Updated OpenAPI Specification

The Business Engine’s [OpenAPI specification](/big/api/) has been refreshed, maintaining seamless integration for third-party developers. This ensures your custom workflows stay in sync with the latest features.
