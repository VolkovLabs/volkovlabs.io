## Revamped Alerting Panel

The updated Alerting panel centralizes alert management with an intuitive layout, aligned with Grafana’s [alerting basics](/big/alerting/).

### Alert Card

Each alert gets a sleek card displaying:

- Title and evaluated panel name.
- Schedule details.
- Status indicators and action buttons.

### Statuses

Two statuses track each alert:

- **Active/Paused**: Is it running or on hold?
- **Run State**:
  - **Scheduled**: Queued but not yet run.
  - **OK**: No breaches or patterns detected.
  - **Alerting**: Thresholds breached or pattern found.
  - **Error**: Issue with query, annotation, or webhook.

New alerts start as **Active** and **Scheduled**. Pausing or editing resets them to **Scheduled**.

### Action Buttons

Four options enabling control:

- **Info**: View alert details.
- **Pause/Active**: Toggle the alert’s state.
- **Edit**: Open the edit drawer (resets to **Scheduled** on save).
- **Delete**: Remove the alert with confirmation.

## Regex Pattern Evaluation

A new **Regex Pattern** option joins **Thresholds** in alert evaluations:

- **Thresholds**: Checks data against panel-defined limits.
- **Regex Pattern**: Scans specified fields (optional) for a defined pattern.

See it in the **Evaluation** category above.

## Webhook Enhancements

### Test Connectivity

Verify webhook endpoints with a **Test Connectivity** button in the Edit Webhook drawer.

### Use by Default

Set a webhook as the default—automatically used when none is specified—for seamless alerting.
