# Business Intelligence 1.3.0: Transformations, Thresholds, and Health Checks

We’re excited to introduce Business Intelligence 1.3.0, a proof-of-concept release from Volkov Labs laying the groundwork for expansive future growth in the [Business Intelligence platform](/big/). This update brings:

- **User role support** in the Alerting panel.
- **Threshold color integration** for alert ranges.
- Beta support for **transformations and multi-frames**.
- Enhanced **Grafana health check** with retry and timeout options.

See it in action:

## User Roles in the Alerting Panel

The Alerting panel now respects Grafana user roles, tailoring access to actions:

### Alert Rules Page

- **Admins/Editors**: Full access—**Info**, **Pause/Resume**, **Edit**, **Delete**.
- **Viewers**: Limited to **Info** and **Pause/Resume**.

/>

### Webhooks Page

- **Admins/Editors**: All options—**Test**, **Edit**, **Delete**.
- **Viewers**: Only **Test** available.

:::info Note  
A greyed-out **Delete** button means the webhook is tied to an active alert rule and can’t be removed.

## Threshold Colors for Alerts

The BI Engine now uses **Thresholds** colors to define allowable data ranges, triggering alerts when values stray outside. Normal ranges require no action, keeping your focus where it matters.

In this example (allowable range: 50-80), three alert records highlight breaches:

- Alert 1: Temperature drops below 40.
- Alert 2: Spikes to 94.7, then dips to 20.4.
- Alert 3: Hits 93.4, then falls to 21.1.

Annotations (light blue areas) mark these events, with gaps reflecting abrupt data shifts. Alerts run periodically, so ongoing breaches extend annotations over time.

## Transformations and Multi-Frames (Beta)

Alert rules tie to specific dashboards and panels:

/>

### Multi-Frames

Now, BI supports multi-frame data sets—alerts apply across all frames from a data source. For example, monitoring three devices:

- Alert triggers when any device (e.g., Device 2) exceeds the range.
- Alert resolves when the last device (e.g., Device 3) returns to normal.

### Transformations

Grafana transformations are now in beta. While most should work, the variety means some may need further tuning—stay tuned for updates.

:::info Beta Status  
Transformation support is evolving due to Grafana’s extensive options.

## Grafana Health Check Enhancements

The BI Engine relies on Grafana, but startup timing can vary. If Grafana lags, the BI Engine might fail its health check and shut down. New retry and timeout parameters prevent this, with a default wait of 5 seconds—customizable as needed.

```sh
##
## Service Account
## - Viewer permission is required to access dashboards
## - Editor permission is required to access dashboards and add Annotations
##
GRAFANA_TOKEN=SERVICE-ACCOUNT-TOKEN

##
## Grafana HTTP API
##
GRAFANA_URL=http://grafana:3000

##
## Grafana Health-Check timeout, ms
## Waiting for Grafana availability for (Timeout * Number of Retries / 1000 ) seconds
##
GRAFANA_HEALTH_CHECK_TIMEOUT=1000

##
## Grafana Health-Check number of retries
##
GRAFANA_HEALTH_CHECK_RETRY=5
```
