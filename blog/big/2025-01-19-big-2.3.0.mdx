## Effortless License Token Updates

Transitioning from a Community to a Production license is now a breeze. Forget about fiddling with environment variables—Business Studio makes it simple:

- Navigate to **Update Engine License** in the settings.
- Enter your new token in the **Token** field and click **Save**.
- **Outcome**: Both Business Studio and Engine licenses are updated in one go.

## Stay Current with Auto-Updates

Business Studio now automatically checks for updates on GitHub every hour (available for MacOS and Windows). When a new version is released, a convenient dialog prompts you to restart and apply the update, ensuring you’re always using the latest features without any manual effort.

## Fine-Tune Alerts with Results Sample Size

Take control of your alert data with the new **Results Sample Size** parameter, designed to manage how many alert rows are saved for analysis:

1. Select an engine, navigate to **Alert Rules**, and choose a rule.
2. On the **Settings** page under **Evaluation**, select **All Values** or **Percentage** (note: not available for **Last Value**).
3. Define the sample size in the **Event** section.

This feature helps you balance data depth with manageability, ensuring actionable insights without overload.

## Craft Alert Messages with Monaco Code Editor

Elevate your alert message creation with the [Monaco code editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/), now integrated into the action edit window. Key features include:

- Full support for Handlebars syntax.
- Intelligent code suggestions (triggered by typing `.` after `event`).
- Automatic code formatting for clean, readable templates.

Instantly preview your messages on the **Preview** page to ensure they’re just right.

## Optimized Alert Condition Overrides

We’ve refined alert condition overrides for better efficiency. A dedicated table in the [Business Engine database schema](/big/engine/database/) and other performance enhancements ensure smoother operations. Explore the updated schema for a deeper look at these improvements.
