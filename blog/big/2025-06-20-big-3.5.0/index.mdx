## Enhanced Alerting with No Data Tag for Better Insights

Effective alerting is the backbone of monitoring, and Business Intelligence 3.5.0 takes it up a notch with a dedicated "No Data" tag for alert evaluations. This feature flags alerts triggered by missing data, helping you quickly pinpoint and resolve gaps in your data streams.

With this added transparency, you can focus on actionable issues rather than chasing false positives. It’s a small change with a big impact, ensuring your alerting workflows are precise and reliable.

## Alert Event Stability Fix for High-Load Reliability

In high-pressure environments, alert reliability is non-negotiable. We’ve tackled this in Business Intelligence 3.5.0 by resolving critical race conditions in alert event processing. This fix guarantees consistent handling of alerts, even during peak loads, preventing missed notifications or delays.

This fix ensures stable and reliable processing, even during peak usage, so you can trust that your alerts will be handled accurately and in a timely manner. This improvement is crucial for maintaining operational continuity in demanding environments.

## Refreshed UI and Menu Icons for Seamless Navigation

A great user experience starts with intuitive design. In this release, we’ve modernized the interface with updated menu icons and subtle UI enhancements. These changes streamline navigation, making it easier to access critical features and workflows.

We’ve also prioritized accessibility, ensuring the platform is inclusive and user-friendly for all. These refinements save time and reduce friction, letting you focus on what matters—driving insights from your data.

## Robust Error Handling in Studio for Uninterrupted Workflows

Unexpected errors shouldn’t derail your day. Business Intelligence 3.5.0 introduces a powerful runtime error handler in Business Studio, designed to manage issues smoothly. With clear feedback and actionable steps, it minimizes disruptions and keeps your workflows on track.
