## Smarter Alerting with "No Data" Tag for Clearer Insights

Alerting is the cornerstone of effective monitoring, and Business Intelligence 3.5.0 elevates it with a new "No Data" tag for alert evaluations. This feature highlights alerts triggered by missing data, enabling you to quickly identify and address gaps in your data streams.

This added clarity helps you focus on real issues instead of false positives, making your alerting workflows more precise and actionable.

## Alert Event Stability Fix for High-Load Dependability

In high-stakes environments, alert reliability is critical. Business Intelligence 3.5.0 addresses this by fixing key race conditions in alert event processing. This ensures consistent and timely alert handling, even during peak loads, preventing missed notifications or delays.
