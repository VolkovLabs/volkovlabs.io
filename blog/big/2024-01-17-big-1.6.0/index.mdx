# Variables support, Prometheus data source, and alert history in Business Intelligence 1.6.0

We are excited to announce the release of the Business Intelligence App, version 1.6.0. It accumulates massive functionality enhancements and, thus, marks an important milestone in transitioning from a POC (proof of concept) to a development type of release.

The Business Intelligence App, version 1.6.0 includes the following updates:

- Allowed Variables support.
- Added Support for Prometheus data source.
- Enabled Prometheus monitoring.
- Extended UI functionality.
- Added Alert History.

## Variables Support

Supporting dashboard variables greatly simplifies work with configuring the alerting in general. Let's say, you have two very similar devices and your task is to monitor their technical health by creating alerts in the event of an alert rule breach.

Your alert rules are almost identical for both devices with only thresholds being slightly different. For instance, the CPU usage of one device must stay within the 0 to 2 percent range and the other CPU usage can go over 2%.

Without dashboard variables, you have to create two separate alert rules. For a small number of devices, this approach is reasonable. However, it turns into a severe headache once instead of two devices you need to maintain hundreds. For every device, you will have to create and maintain a separate alert rule containing an identical query.

With dashboard variables enabled, creating one alert rule is enough. The thresholds could be configured in the **Overrides**.

Here is an example of the Time Series visualization where one data series triggers an alert and another does not.

Below is what the configuration of the alert rule using dashboard variables looks like.

### Prometheus Data Source

At this stage, we ensured that the BI App supports the variables in Prometheus Data Source. Some data source has unique support for the variables and we plan to support the most popular of them in the future.

## Enabled Prometheus Monitoring

In this release, we added a Prometheus middleware and container to allow the collection of the BI Engine system health statistics. Having Prometheus monitoring built-in in the BI App allows you to monitor the alerting system itself. Being an outside system, the BI App is an excellent choice for observing the observability system while using the familiar interface.

Following the enabling of the Prometheus monitoring, we crafted a [ready-to-use, out-of-the-box dashboard](https://github.com/VolkovLabs/business-intelligence/blob/main/provisioning/dashboards/engine.json) with all necessary metrics for kick-off the successful monitoring.

The BI Engine consists of two components which provides metrics:

- API Server - **Instance** `engine:3001`
- Scheduler - **Instance** `engine:3002`

## Alert rules workflow

The below schema illustrates the conceptual workflow from the user point of view. Prometheus serves to collect all system health-related and other data to ensure troubleshooting and reporting on system behavior.

## Extended UI functionality

### Actions

To align with the alerting basics terminology [Alert rule-Alert record-Alert action](/big/alerting/), we renamed the **Webhooks** tab into the **Actions** tab.

### Annotations

In the Edit mode->**Action category**->**Add annotations** parameter, now you can specify whether you need to attach them to a panel or a dashboard (i.e. all panels of the specified dashboard).

  src="/img/blog/2024-01-17-big-1.6.0/alerting-panel.png"
/>

### Alert details

For the alert rules in the **Alerting** and **Error** statuses, we added the **Event Details** category.

To review, click the **Details** button on an alert card, then **Event Details** header.

  title="Event details for the alert rules in the Alerting and Error statuses."
  src="/img/blog/2024-01-17-big-1.6.0/event-details.png"
/>

## Alert History

We added a new option to the **Request** parameter of the Business Intelligence Engine data source. It allows you to display alert history in a visualization panel of your choice.

In the example below, the alert history is displayed in the Table visualization panel.

<GettingStarted />

### Docker Compose

The `docker-compose.yml` file consists of the following containers:

- **Grafana** includes the provisioned BI Engine data source, an Alerting panel, and dashboards.
- **Timescale** is required to store configuration, events, rules, etc.
- **BI Engine** has a service account key to access Grafana HTTP APIs. It evaluates alert rules and calls webhooks when alert statuses change.
- **JSON webhook** is a webhook example based on NodeJS, which accepts alert payload and saves it to the files for testing purposes.
- **Prometheus** collects and store performance metrics from BI Engine.

<Code
  url="https://github.com/VolkovLabs/business-intelligence/blob/main/docker-compose.yml"
  language="yaml"
/>

### Start

When you run a docker-compose file, it launches the Grafana, Timescale, BI Engine, Prometheus and Webhook containers:

```sh
docker compose pull && docker compose up
```

### Stop

Stop and remove all containers:

```sh
docker compose down
```
