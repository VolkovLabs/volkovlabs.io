## Revamped Alerting Page

Responding to user feedback about navigation and alert management challenges, we’ve redesigned the alerting page with a more intuitive interface. The updated layout simplifies locating and managing alerts, while advanced filtering options let you sort by specific criteria. This reduces manual search time and boosts efficiency, especially for teams monitoring large-scale systems in Grafana.

## Data Preview Feature

Setting up alerts just got easier. The new Data Preview feature, embedded in the Alert Settings page, allows you to view a snapshot of relevant data without leaving the page or running separate queries. This saves time, minimizes setup errors, and ensures alerts are based on accurate data, building confidence in your monitoring system.

## Alert Notification History

Transparency is key in critical decision-making environments. The Alert Notification History feature provides a comprehensive log of past notifications, including trigger times and conditions. This is essential for auditing, troubleshooting false positives, and meeting compliance requirements, especially in high-stakes operations.

## Enhanced Clustering

For distributed environments, clustering is vital to scaling Business Intelligence deployments. The updated clustering pages now display the latest alerts and engine lists, offering better visibility and control over your setup.

## Localization Support

To serve a global audience, Business Intelligence 3.3.1 introduces Spanish language support. This update removes language barriers, making the platform more accessible and user-friendly for Spanish-speaking teams and organizations, fostering greater adoption worldwide.

## Personalization Options

Enhancing user experience, this release lets you customize themes through profile settings. Whether you prefer light or dark mode, tailoring the platform’s appearance ensures comfort during long monitoring sessions and creates a more engaging interaction with Grafana dashboards.

## New Data Source

With the addition of Loki as a data source, logging capabilities are significantly enhanced. Designed for scalability, Loki enables seamless log aggregation alongside metrics and visualizations in Grafana. This unified view is invaluable for debugging, event correlation, and gaining deeper insights into application performance in complex systems.

## Faster Alert Processing

In high-volume monitoring scenarios, performance is critical. Customizable batch sizes for alerts and annotations in Engine settings allow administrators to fine-tune throughput and resource usage. This ensures faster alert delivery without system overload, ideal for organizations with large datasets or frequent alert triggers.
