## Revamped Alerting Page

Based on user feedback about navigation challenges, we’ve redesigned the alerting page with a user-friendly interface. The new layout simplifies finding and managing alerts, while advanced filtering options allow sorting by specific criteria. This saves time and boosts efficiency, especially for teams monitoring large-scale systems in Grafana.

## Data Preview Feature

Setting up alerts is now simpler than ever. The Data Preview feature, integrated into the Alert Settings page, lets you view a snapshot of relevant data without switching tabs or running separate queries. This reduces setup errors and builds confidence in your monitoring system by ensuring alerts are based on accurate data.

## Alert Notification History

Transparency is crucial in critical environments. The Alert Notification History feature offers a comprehensive log of past notifications, including trigger times and conditions. This is invaluable for auditing, troubleshooting false positives, and meeting compliance requirements in high-stakes operations.

## Enhanced Clustering

For distributed environments, clustering is essential for scaling Business Intelligence deployments. The updated clustering pages now display the latest alerts and engine lists, providing greater visibility and control over your infrastructure.

## New Data Source

The addition of Loki as a data source significantly boosts logging capabilities. Designed for scalability, Loki enables seamless log aggregation alongside metrics and visualizations in Grafana. This unified view is critical for debugging, event correlation, and gaining deeper insights into application performance.

## Faster Alert Processing

Performance is paramount in high-volume monitoring scenarios. Customizable batch sizes for alerts and annotations in Engine settings allow administrators to fine-tune throughput and resource usage. This ensures faster alert delivery without overloading the system, ideal for organizations with large datasets or frequent triggers.
