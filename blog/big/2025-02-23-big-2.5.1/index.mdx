# Thresholds ranges, cluster load balancing, and UI updates in Business Intelligence 2.5.1

We are excited to announce the public preview release of the Business Intelligence platform 2.5.1. It includes the following updates:

- Improved the usability of the colored ranges in the alert rule settings.
- Revised cluster load balancing.
- General UI improvements and usability updates.

## Usability of the colored ranges in the alert rule settings

Sometimes, a miniature UI change leads to substantial usability improvements. This is precisely what happened here. Instead of the legacy Grafana representation of a range where only the lower boundary is shown, we added the high boundary.

No more guessing games of what the range exactly is.

## Revised cluster load balancing

We strive to achieve a high performance in business intelligence. The revised approach to cluster load balancing is one of the things that helps the cause. In this release, we worked on better alert balancing between connected Business engines.

The existing architecture allows for running specific queries on specific business engines and completely avoids unnecessary duplication.

## General UI improvements and usability updates

These updates enhance the user experience in Business Studio.

- Enhanced support for dashboard variables within the target panel.
- Enhanced sorting of evaluation results to maintain consistent ordering.
