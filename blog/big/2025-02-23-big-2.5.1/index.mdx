# Business Intelligence 2.5.1: Threshold Ranges, Load Balancing, and UI Enhancements

We’re excited to unveil the public preview of Business Intelligence 2.5.1, a release from Volkov Labs that refines the [Business Intelligence platform](/big/) with:

- Clearer **threshold ranges** in alert rule settings.
- Optimized **cluster load balancing** for better performance.
- Polished **UI enhancements** for a smoother experience.

Dive into the details below to see how these updates elevate your alerting and management capabilities.

## Clearer Threshold Ranges in Alert Rules

Small UI tweaks can yield big wins. In 2.5.1, we’ve upgraded the threshold range display in alert rule settings. Previously, Grafana showed only the lower boundary, leaving the upper limit unclear. Now, both low and high boundaries are visible—eliminating guesswork and making alert thresholds intuitive at a glance.

## Optimized Cluster Load Balancing

Performance is a cornerstone of Business Intelligence, and this release refines **cluster load balancing** to deliver just that. We’ve enhanced how alerts are distributed across connected Business Engines, ensuring efficient workload management.

The architecture now better assigns specific queries to specific engines, avoiding duplication and boosting reliability—whether you’re handling dozens or hundreds of alerts.

## UI Enhancements for a Smoother Experience

Business Studio’s user experience gets a lift with these updates:

- **Dashboard Variables:** Improved support within target panels for more flexible alerting.
- **Evaluation Sorting:** Consistent ordering of results for easier analysis.

These refinements streamline navigation and interaction, making your workflow more efficient.
