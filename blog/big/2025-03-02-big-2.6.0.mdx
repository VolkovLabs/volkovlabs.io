## Seamless Grafana Transformation Compatibility

Business Intelligence 2.6.0 is fully aligned with Grafana 11.5.2 transformations, ensuring smooth integration. While most core Grafana transformations—built on a universal framework—function flawlessly, certain specialized transformations tied to specific data sources or use cases may exhibit inconsistencies.

## Optimized Business Engine Docker Image

## Updated OpenAPI Specification
