# Building a Scalable BI Solution with Grafana: Managing Hundreds of Alerts

In a data-driven world, delivering actionable insights to clients is critical. Imagine Alex Carter, a Data Analyst tasked with deploying a Business Intelligence (BI) platform using Grafana, where each external client receives a dedicated instance to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs).

This post explores Alex’s project, introduces the key personas involved, tackles the challenge of managing hundreds of alerts, and demonstrates how [Business Studio](/big/studio/) from the [Business Intelligence platform](/big/) enhances this setup with high-performance alerting and load balancing.

## The Project: One Grafana per Client

Alex, a seasoned BI Developer at a mid-sized tech firm, leads an initiative to provide tailored dashboards for external clients—think e-commerce retailers or logistics firms. Each client gets a dedicated Grafana instance to track KPIs like sales figures, delivery times, or app uptime.

This multi-instance approach ensures data isolation and customization but poses scaling and alert management challenges as the client base expands.

## Meet the Personas

- **Alex Carter (Data Analyst/BI Developer)**

  - Experience: 5+ years with Grafana, SQL, and Python.
  - Goal: Deliver scalable dashboards and alerts with minimal overhead.
  - Challenges: Managing multiple instances, processing large datasets, and supporting non-technical users.

- **Sarah Mitchell (Business Operations Manager)**

  - Role: Internal user monitoring operational KPIs.
  - Need: Set alerts like “inventory < 100 units.”
  - Struggle: Relies on Alex due to Grafana’s technical complexity.

- **Raj Patel (Regional Sales Manager)**
  - Role: External client using dashboards for sales KPIs.
  - Need: Custom alerts like “sales < $5K.”
  - Struggle: Finds Grafana’s alert setup daunting as a non-technical user.

Learn more about these personas in the [documentation](/big/personas/).

## The Challenge: Managing Hundreds of Alerts

Alex’s setup involves:

- **Dashboards:** Tailored for each client (e.g., sales trends for Client A, uptime for Client B) using Grafana’s templating and panels.
- **Data Sources:** Varied—SQL databases, Prometheus, BigQuery—linked to each instance.
- **Alerts:** Client-specific (e.g., “revenue < $10K” for Client A), delivered via Slack, SMS, or email.
- **Scale:** Dozens of instances, escalating to hundreds of alerts as clients grow.

Key hurdles include:

- **Scalability:** Configuring and monitoring hundreds of alerts across multiple instances is a logistical challenge.
- **Performance:** Large datasets (e.g., 10M rows) tax resources, slowing dashboards and alert evaluation.
- **Client Autonomy:** Non-technical users like Raj want to manage alerts but lack the skills for Grafana’s query-based system.

## Enter Business Studio

Business Studio, paired with the Business Engine, transforms Alex’s project into a robust BI solution capable of handling hundreds of alerts. Developed by Volkov Labs, this platform integrates with Grafana to deliver advanced alerting, load balancing, and an intuitive interface. Its latest release ([Business Intelligence 2.6.0](/big/release/)) aligns perfectly with Alex’s needs.

### How Business Studio Empowers Alex

1. **Scalability with Load Balancing**
   - **Feature:** Business Studio’s cluster of [Business Engines](/big/studio/manage-business-engines/) distributes hundreds of alert rules across engines, managed via a load balancing page.
   - **Impact:** Alex scales effortlessly to 50+ clients, with each engine handling ~20 alerts. Adding 10+ instances is seamless with balanced workloads.

/>

2. **Efficient Alert Management**

   - **Feature:** The Business Engine cluster processes hundreds of alerts concurrently, optimized for volume over individual speed.
   - **Impact:** Alerts execute reliably once across the cluster, avoiding overload on Grafana data sources.

3. **Reliability via High Availability**
   - **Feature:** High Availability (HA) clusters and action history ensure consistent alert execution, even during engine failures.
   - **Impact:** A client’s uptime alert fires reliably amidst hundreds of rules, reaching Slack without disruption, enhancing trust.

/>

4. **Simplified Management**
   - **Feature:** A centralized UI and API enable Alex to manage hundreds of alerts from one hub, using reusable templates.
   - **Impact:** Alex deploys a “low sales” alert for all clients in minutes, tweaking thresholds ($10K for Client A, $5K for Client B) via a script.

5. **Empowering Clients**
   - **Feature:** An intuitive UI with dropdowns and data previews simplifies alert creation for non-technical users.
   - **Impact:** Raj sets a “sales < $5K” alert independently, reducing Alex’s workload by 80% for basic requests.

6. **Flexible Notifications**
   - **Feature:** Multi-channel delivery (Slack, SMS, etc.) with customizable templates.
   - **Impact:** Alex manages diverse notification preferences—Slack for Client A, SMS for Client C—from a single interface.

### Implementation Snapshot

- **Setup:** Alex deploys a 5-engine cluster via Docker, connecting each to a client’s Grafana instance.
- **Workflow:** Designs dashboards in Grafana, defines hundreds of alerts in Business Studio, and monitors load via the balancing page.
- **Client Access:** Raj gains viewer-level access to adjust alerts, with HA ensuring reliability.

## Real-World Example

- **Scenario:** An alert for “delivery time > 4 hours” among hundreds of rules across 1M records.
- **Before:** Grafana struggled to manage hundreds of alerts, bogging down instances.
- **After:** Business Studio’s cluster processes it alongside others, sending an SMS reliably. Raj adds a “fleet idle > 10%” alert via the UI—no help needed.

## Measurable Wins

- **Time Savings:** Alert setup time drops 60% with centralized management.
- **Capacity:** Handles hundreds of alerts without performance degradation.
- **Autonomy:** 80% of clients manage basic alerts independently.
- **Reliability:** Achieves 99.99% uptime with HA.
- **Scalability:** Supports 10x growth with ease.

## A Game-Changer for BI

Business Studio by Volkov Labs elevates Alex’s multi-instance Grafana project into a scalable BI powerhouse adept at managing hundreds of alerts. Load-balanced, high-performance alerting meets client needs, streamlines Alex’s workflow, and enables users like Sarah and Raj.

Whether you’re a BI expert like Alex or a business user like Raj, this platform showcases Grafana’s potential as a client-facing BI tool.
