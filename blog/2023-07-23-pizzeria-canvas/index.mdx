# Pizzeria Observability on Grafana Canvas panel

Grafana 10 was released in June 2023 and it's the best Grafana release yet. In the latest release, the canvas panel becomes generally available. It's mature enough to be used in the production environment. We saw the presentation of the house's energy with metrics and animated wind turbines and were excited to try it ourselves.

We know that Grafana can be used for the Observability of K8s clusters, monitoring logs and traces. Is it possible to utilize Grafana for observing the operations of a pizzeria and do it in style?

## Mockup

We started by designing the layout of the panel in Figma. Canvas panel requires background to be a raster image, custom elements are based on vector SVG graphics. Figma can do both at the same time!

We selected the most important metrics to track in the pizzeria observability journey:

- Number of online and walk-in orders.
- How many order was completed today.
- Revenue based on the completed orders.
- Waiting time for walk-in customers.
- Monitor the status of the ovens and see the progress of pizza cooking.

The pizza oven includes:

- Timer to display how much time is left.
- Lights, fire and knob lights to indicate that the oven is working.
- Pizza opacity indicates how well the pizza is cooked.

## Background

The data metrics were removed from the Mockup and will be replaced with data elements on the canvas panel. Pizza ovens will be replaced with advanced custom elements.

The exported background file can be placed in the `public/img/bg/` folder mapped in the Docker container or referenced from the URL in the panel's options:

## Pizza oven

As we mentioned the wind turbine, drone and server elements in the canvas panel look interesting, but these kinds of elements can't be easily incorporated in the working version of Grafana. New advanced elements should be scripted in the Grafana source code, compiled and built into the new Docker container to take advantage of.

Creating new advanced elements starts with a transparent SVG file. This file will be used in the React display component. We recommend including `id` attributes to identify and animate layers.

Created oven's layers consist of text, vector, and ellipse elements with added filters and effects for a natural look and feel.

## Advanced canvas element

The advanced canvas element consist of:

- Definition with id, name, and description.
- Options with default parameters for background, and placement.
- UI options for element configuration.
- Function to return data from data sources.
- React component to display the element.

### Element definitions

All custom elements should be identified with id, name and description. Name and description will be displayed for user selection in the panel options. The default size should be set based on the exported SVG width and height.

```js
export const pizzaOvenItem: CanvasElementItem = {
  id: "pizzaOven",
  name: "Pizza Oven",
  description: "Animated pizza oven",
  display: PizzaOvenDisplay,
  defaultSize: {
    width: 200,
    height: 300,
  },
};
```

### UI configuration options

We selected `state` and `time` options as input dimensions which can be set as fixed or data source field values:

- `state` controls lights, fire and knob lights to indicate that the oven is working.
- `time` displays how much time is left and controls the opacity of the pizza layers.

```js
registerOptionsUI: (builder: any) => {
  const category = ["Pizza Oven"];
  builder
    .addCustomEditor({
      category,
      id: "state",
      path: "config.state",
      name: "State",
      editor: ResourceDimensionEditor,
    })
    .addCustomEditor({
      category,
      id: "time",
      path: "config.time",
      name: "Time",
      editor: ResourceDimensionEditor,
    });
};
```

### Values from data sources

Based on the configured options values will be static or returned from the data source. To create a `data` structure to display elements we used `getResource` method to retrieve the last value from the data source.

```js
  prepareData: (ctx: DimensionContext, cfg: PizzaOvenConfig) => {
    const stateValues = cfg?.state && ctx.getResource(cfg.state).field?.values || [];
    const timeValues = cfg?.time && ctx.getResource(cfg.time).field?.values || [];

    const data: PizzaOvenData = {
      state: stateValues.length && stateValues[stateValues.length-1],
      time: timeValues.length ? timeValues[timeValues.length-1] : 0
    };

    return data;
  },
```

### React display component

The display component for the pizza oven returns SVG graphics with smoke animation and is controlled by the configured UI options and data source values.

The proposed canvas element was created in the `public/app/features/canvas/elements/` folder and included in the registry (`public/app/features/canvas/registry.ts`) as an advanced element item:

```js
export const defaultElementItems = [
  metricValueItem, // default for now
  textItem,
  rectangleItem,
  iconItem,
  serverItem,
];

export const advancedElementItems = [
  buttonItem,
  windTurbineItem,
  droneTopItem,
  droneFrontItem,
  droneSideItem,
  pizzaOvenItem,
];

export const canvasElementRegistry =
  new Registry() <
  CanvasElementItem >
  (() => [...defaultElementItems, ...advancedElementItems]);
```

### Developing and building a Docker image

To get started with Grafana development on Mac or Linux:

1. Clone repository `git clone https://github.com/grafana/grafana.git`
2. Install dependencies `yarn install --immutable`
3. Start Frontend: `yarn start`
4. Start Backend: `make run`

Developing and building Docker images is explained in the [Grafana developer guide](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/contribute/developer-guide.md).

If you followed all the steps you should see a Pizza Oven advanced element in the list:

## PostgreSQL with Timescale data source

For the demonstration, we used the PostgreSQL with Timescale database, which is the ultimate storage partner for Grafana. You can find an explanation in the tutorial:

  title="Ultimate storage partner for Grafana."
/>

The table `orders` to keep track of online and walk-in orders and the cooking progress:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id integer GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    created timestamp with time zone NOT NULL,
    name text,
    phone text,
    description text,
    online boolean,
    price integer,
    oven integer,
    started timestamp with time zone NOT NULL
);

CREATE SEQUENCE seq_orders START 1;

insert into orders values(nextval('seq_orders'), now(), 'Mike', '123-456-789', 'Cheese Pizza', true, 19.99, 1, now());
insert into orders values(nextval('seq_orders'), now(), 'Ella', '132-461-782', 'Pepperoni Pizza', false, 24.99, 2, now());
```

## The canvas panel is awesome

The canvas panel can be used for a variety of use cases, Pizzeria included. We started working on a YouTube tutorial on how we configured the data source, prepared data, and configured the canvas panel.
