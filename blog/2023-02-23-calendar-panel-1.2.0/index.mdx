## Updated Styles

Theme v1 was upgraded to v2, and most styles were modified for a modern look and the provision of a Google Calendar-like experience. **Display Time** is an additional option that displays the time of an event before the title.

## Week Start

The plugin considers the Grafana system settings when choosing the first day of the week - Saturday, Sunday, or Monday, or uses the default day from Grafana settings.

## Event colors

We have released the most frequently requested feature! You can now color events differently depending on whether their values fall inside the chosen threshold ranges.

## Event details

The `N more` line appears at the bottom of the event list when events do not fit within the allocated day cell. When you click this line, the opened tab will display the full list of events for that day. You may also click an event to view its information in a new tab.

You can also click a particular event directly on the calendar grid to see its details or navigate to the first data link if the `On Click` option is set to `Open Link`.

## Time Range

To filter events against a time range, click a specific day in the calendar. Then, hold down the Shift key and drag the selection to the appropriate day. Click **Apply time range** to confirm the selection. The selected time range will be applied to all events in your calendar.
