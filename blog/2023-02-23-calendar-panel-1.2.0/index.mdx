## Event details

When day events don't fit into the day space an entry `N more` appears at the bottom. When clicking on it you can see a full list of the day's events in a drawer. You can select the event and a new tab will be opened with the details for the specific event.

You can also click on the event directly on the panel to see the details or navigate to the first data link if the `On Click` option is set to `Open Link`.
