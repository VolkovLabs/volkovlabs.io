## Updated Styles

Outdated Theme v1 was updated to v2 and most styles were updated for a modern look and feel similar to the Google Calendar experience. An additional option Display Time allows displaying the time of the event in front of the title.

## Event details

When day events don't fit into the day space an entry `N more` appears at the bottom. When clicking on it you can see a full list of the day's events in a drawer. You can select the event and a new tab will be opened with the details for the specific event.

You can also click on the event directly on the panel to see the details or navigate to the first data link if the `On Click` option is set to `Open Link`.

## Time Range

It is possible to update the Time Range by selecting days on the Calendar panel. Click on the day's number and holding the Shift key click on another day selecting the period.

When the period is selected click on the Apply time range to adjust the time range for the dashboard.
