## Business Charts Panel

Usually, we quite easily come up with good, memorable names for our plugins. However, with this plugin, we have struggled a bit.

After two years of having our plugin bear a working title, we realized that all that time we worked on the panel that can help visualize any business data, that this plugin is ideal for anyone who creates business dashboards, and that the plugin name should be **Business Charts Panel**. Simple rebranding means all existing features get carried over.

Please welcome the new name for the same unique and needed functionality!

## Downloads

The Business Charts Panel has been downloaded more than 2 million times! It is an incredible number. We are thrilled to see our plugin in a huge demand around the world.

## Visual Editor

:::info Beta version
This feature is in the beta version. As of now, it should work for simple charts. If you need anything advanced, please, use the **Code** mode.
:::

/>

This is one of the most exciting features. Instead of using JavaScript code, you can use UI elements to specify many chart parameters.

### Visual Editor Examples

To get you started faster, we have prepared many examples of how the **Visual Editor** can be used. Please, check out our [echarts.volkovlabs.io](https://echarts.volkovlabs.io/) project.

1. Find the chart that looks the most of what you need to create.
2. Open it in Edit mode.
3. Review how the Visual Editor elements are configured.

## Auto size editor

This new feature automatically changes the size of the code editor depending on the number of rows in it. It is an intuitive feature that takes usability to the next level. Now users can work with their code with fewer distractions.

## Context parameters

:::warning Breaking changes
All available parameters are now combined under the context parameter
:::

Just type **context** and all available options will appear. It makes the searches of what you need easier.

However, note, that previously we allowed the direct call, then now it has stopped working. In order to migrate to this release, please, ensure to reference **context** as a prefix to all options.

## Grafana 10 and Grafana 11

:::warning Breaking changes
Grafana 9 is not supported.
:::

Our plugins always follow the latest Grafana versions and stay compatible with the most recent releases. That means, however, that we have to sunset the support of obsolete releases.

The latest Business Charts Panel 6.0.0 fully supports Grafana 10 and the upcoming 11 releases.

## Getting Started

You can install the Business Charts Panel from the [Grafana Plugins catalog](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/volkovlabs-echarts-panel/) or using the Grafana command line tool.

For the latter, please use the following command.

```bash
grafana-cli plugins install volkovlabs-echarts-panel
```

## YouTube Tutorial
