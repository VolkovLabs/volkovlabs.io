## Big Calendar

The Big Calendar is a new implementation of the calendar panel based on the powerful React library.

It introduces a multi-language toolbar that allows to:

1. Switch between Month, Week and Day views.
2. Get back to Today.
3. Display events from the previous and next selected time range.

## Legacy Calendar

The Legacy Calendar is a native implementation of the calendar panel based on the custom components. Compare to the Big Calendar it does not provide a toolbar and has limited support of week and day views.

The legacy Calendar allows you to display multi months of events by scrolling.
