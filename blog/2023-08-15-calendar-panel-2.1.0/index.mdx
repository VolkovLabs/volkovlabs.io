## Big Calendar

Big Calendar is a new version of the calendar panel based on a powerful React library.

It adds a multi-language toolbar that allows you to:

1. Switch between month, week, and day views.
2. Switch back to the current day (today).
3. Display events from the previous and subsequent time ranges.

## Legacy calendar

The legacy calendar is a native implementation of the calendar based on custom components. Unlike Big Calendar, it does not provide a toolbar and has limited support for week and day views.

The legacy calendar allows you to display events from several months and scroll through them.

## Multi-language support

The legacy calendar and Big Calendar support dates in four native Grafana languages: Spanish, French, German, and simplified Chinese. Big Calendar also provides a multi-language toolbar.
