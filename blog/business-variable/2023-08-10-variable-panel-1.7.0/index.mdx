# Business Variable 1.7.0

We are happy to announce the release of the Variable Panel 1.7.0. This release includes the following updates:

- Added the Button display mode.
- Added group selection for the Tree View layout (beta).
- Added support of the Grafana key-value variable format for the <b>Table</b> display mode.

<Catalog date="August 11, 2023" />

## Button display mode

In the Button display mode, you get horizontally positioned variable values instead of them being placed from top to bottom. Optionally, you can set up color-coding rules in the Thresholds category on the right.

## Group selection

:::info
This parameter is still under development and now is available in the Beta version. Try it out with care.
:::

In the Layout category, for the Tree View, we added a new parameter, 'Allow group selection'. When it is enabled, choosing a root of the group will automatically select all elements belonging to this group.

## Key-values format in Variables

A Grafana variable can be composed of a key and value to make it possible to join data sets by IDs(key) while displaying user-friendly names(value).

Starting from this release, the Variable panel in the <b>Table</b> view supports this feature.

In the illustration below, screen 1, the `city` variable is created with three key-value pairs.

```text
Chicago:1, New York:2, Tampa:3
```

Screen 2 is a dashboard view where an end-user sees only city names. After the selection is made (here, New York:2), the variable carries a value equal to 2.

From there the `city` variable's value can be used in the queries for other panels, screen 3.
