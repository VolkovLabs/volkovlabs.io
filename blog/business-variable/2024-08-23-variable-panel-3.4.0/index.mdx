## TreeView: Data Source for favorites

Previously, the Business Variable panel stored the selected favorites in the browser, which is an excellent solution in many cases. 
However, some users use multiple devices and browsers to work with the Grafana dashboard or need to clean their cookies often. 

For these users, we added a new section, **Favorites**, where they can configure storing the favorites in a data source.

SQL to create the table used in the illustration above:

```sql
CREATE TABLE favorites (
    id serial primary key,
    variable text NOT NULL,
    value text NOT NULL,
    user_id integer NOT NULL
);
```

Example of how the favorites table can be populated:

| id    | variable  |  value  | user_id |
| ------|-----------|---------|-------- |
|   2   | device    | Device5 |    1    |
|   3   | device    | Device3 |    1    |

## TreeView: Custom image for the Grafana Thresholds

Grafana Thresholds functionality provides a better visual representation of data on your dashboard. To enhance it, we added the possibility of specifying an SVG image instead of a simple colored circle!

## TreeView: Collapse/Expand on initial load

It is a self-explanatory option. You can regulate your ThreeView's appearance after the dashboard is open.

## TreeView: Tabs order

In case of multiple tabs, you can specify their order in the **Tab order** parameter:
 - **In order**. The tabs will always be displayed in the same order as they are in the panel options. 
 - **Selected first**. The selected tab will always be displayed first.

## Button view: Reset button 

In the **Button** view, you can use the Reset selection button(x) to unselect everything in one click.

## Button view: Scrollbar

It is a nice change for user experience enhancement. A scrollbar automatically appears in the Button view when needed.
