# Using Query and Data Sources in the Data Manipulation plugin for Grafana

The Data Manipulation plugin drew massive community attention in recent months. With about 500 daily downloads, we were swamped with questions and great ideas for improvements for quite some time.

:::info Thanks
Big thanks to all participating in the creative thinking feast!
:::

When we first introduced this plugin, we knew the functionality it provides had been long awaited for, but we did not anticipate such avalanche demand.

Grafana is famous for its unparalleled data visualization ability. The Data Manipulation plugin is esteemed for extending the Grafana vast visualization arsenal by data manipulation functionality.
In other words, The Data Manipulation plugin gracefully transforms one-way data street into two ways, allowing users to add and update data in the database.

REST API is the first method the Data Manipulation plugin started with. Now, in addition to REST API, you can choose Query and Data Source. We also kept a fully Custom method available for the use cases with the most unusual requirements.

The Query utilizes the standard Grafana data retrieval functionality, which limits this method to exist only in the Initial request data flow.

## The final product

This article describes the steps to complete a basic Grafana project where the central requirement is the user's ability to update a device setting stored in an external database.

Below, you can see a Grafana dashboard with the Data Manipulation plugin. It contains two similar examples with the difference in the Initial Request type. In the first example, I use the Query and in the second, I use the Data Source Initial Request type.

For switching between devices, I chose to use the [Variable panel](/plugins/volkovlabs-variable-panel/). It is unessential to the Data manipulation, but I needed a filter located on the side of the users' forms, hence, my choice.

## Database

PostgreSQL is our go-to database for most of our dummy and production projects. This time is no exception. The data table structure below demonstrates the basics of the Data Manipulation plugin.

The name column captures a device name. The rest of the columns are for corresponding device metrics.

```sql
CREATE TABLE configuration (
    name text,
    max integer not null,
    min integer not null,
    speed integer not null
);

insert into configuration values ('device1', 100, 10, 54);
insert into configuration values ('device2', 60, 0, 10);
insert into configuration values ('device3', 60, 30, 40);
insert into configuration values ('device4', 34, 10, 20);
```

## Initial Request

In the Initial Request, you have a choice of four types:

- Custom[-],
- Data Source,
- Query,
- REST API(GET).

### Query

I selected the Query type for the first example. This method refers to the standard Grafana fetching mechanism. That means you need to have a configured Grafana data source and select it on the left-hand side drop-down. The Data Manipulation supports all Grafana data sources.

The next step is to specify a query. In my example, I use a simple SQL statement to retrieve min, max, and speed metrics from a configuration table for all devices.

Then, I created three form elements, all read-only. Every element is mapped to the corresponding query field.

The Highlight Changes feature, when enabled, displays the modified values with a specified color.

/>

The SQL from the picture above to copy:

```sql
SELECT min, max, speed
FROM configuration
WHERE name = '$device';
```

:::note Good to know
Query exists only as Initial Request type and not as Update Request type. This method utilized Grafana's standard retrieval mechanism, which is one-way in its core and, thus, can only be used in the Initial Request.
:::

### Data Source

When you select Data Source as your Initial Request type, the standard query setting on the left becomes completely irrelevant.

I specified PostgreSQL as a Data Source on the right and the SQL query in the create payload parameter located in the Initial Request Payload section.

Highlight Changes feature for the Data Source type requires to call the `SetInitial()` function in the post-process. In the picture below, I provide the example code with `SetInitial()` function.

<Image
  title="Initial Request using Data Source configuration."
  src="/img/blog/2023-09-08-form-panel-data-source/init-ds.png"
/>

#### Initial Request payload

```js
return {
  rawSql: "select * from configuration where name ='$device';",
  format: "table",
};
```

#### Initial Request Custom Code

```js
const payload = {};

elements.forEach((element) => {
  if (!element.value) {
    return;
  }

  payload[element.id] = element.value;
});

setInitial(payload);
```

## Update Request

In my example, I choose to have the identical update Request for both examples. My configuration is in the picture below.

<Image
  title="Update Request configuration."
  src="/img/blog/2023-09-08-form-panel-data-source/update.png"
/>

### Update Request Payload

```js
const payload = {};

elements.forEach((element) => {
  if (!element.value) {
    return;
  }

  payload[element.id] = element.value;
});

/**
 * Data Source payload
 */
return {
  rawSql: `update configuration set min=${payload.min}, max=${payload.max}, speed=${payload.speed} where name='$device'`,
  format: "table",
};
```

### Update Request Custom Code

```js
if (response && response.ok) {
  notifySuccess(["Update", "Values updated successfully."]);
  initialRequest();
} else {
  notifyError(["Update", "An error occurred updating values."]);
}
```
