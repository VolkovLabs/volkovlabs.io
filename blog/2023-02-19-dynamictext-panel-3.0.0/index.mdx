## Community Use case

We are impressed with the everyday creations from the community using the latest features in the Dynamic Text panel for Grafana.

One of the interesting use cases is creating tabs with styles, JavaScript Code, and a mix of Handlebars with HTML. Previously it can be possible only with custom panels.

## Magic (JavaScript) Trio

Dynamic Text is one of the three plugins that make Grafana complete. Dynamic Text, Data Manipulation and Apache ECharts are all you need to create functional real-world web applications.

## Select Editor to display

To simplify panel options we decided to hide Default Content, JavaScript Code and Styles editors by default.

If you changed the value of Default Content or already using the JavaScript Code, then editors will be displayed even if not selected.

/>

In many cases, you don't need to update the Default Content or use JavaScript Code and Styles. We love the minimalistic design with only the Content editor displayed and I hope you will too.

## Styles editor

You can add custom styles or override the default using the dedicated code editor with CSS syntax highlight.

<Code

  language="js"
/>

</details>

### Padding and margins

To display content without padding and margins override the parent CSS style.

```css
& {
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
}
```

## Code Syntax Highlight

The code syntax highlight is based on the `highlight.js` library, which supports major languages.

### Styling

We included the Accessibility (a11y) syntax highlight style for light and dark themes. You can override it in the Styles editor by copying one of the styles from the [project source files](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/tree/main/src/styles).

<details>
  <summary>a11y Light</summary>

<Code

  language="css"
/>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>a11y Dark</summary>

<Code
  url="https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/blob/main/src/styles/a11y-dark.css"
  language="css"
/>

</details>

## YouTube Tutorial

A Dynamic Text visualization panel is a Grafana plugin that transforms monotone text/table data into vibrant, easy-to-read information cards. The panel supports variables, Markdown and Handlebars.

The Dynamic Text visualization panel lets you define a text template using the data from your data source query.
