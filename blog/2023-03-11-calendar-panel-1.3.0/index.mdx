## Configuration

Our latest video tutorial explains how to configure the Calendar Panel plugin in Grafana. We store our events in the PostgreSQL database, but you can use any supported storage.

### Events Duration

Events are categorized into four types:

1. **instantaneous**: an event having only the start time.
2. **continuing**: an event having the start and end time.
3. **multi-day**: an event having the start and end time and lasting for two days or more.
4. **ongoing**: an event having the start time without the end time.

## Multi-day events

We improved the aligning of multi-day events. In the latest version, events are aligned by week, which prevents in-between gaps for events spanning for more than one week.

Events are displayed in chronological order, with the earliest events appearing at the top.

## Event colors

We improved the coloring options for events. If the Color field is not specified, events can be colored based on Frame ID or Event ID. In the plugin preferences, you can also select the classic palette.

## Event details

The splitting of comma-separated values in the Labels field has been added into event details. The Description field supports the HTML elements that you can use for formatting event descriptions.
