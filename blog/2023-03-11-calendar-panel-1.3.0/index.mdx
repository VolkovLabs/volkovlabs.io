## Configuration

Our latest video tutorial explains how to configure the Calendar plugin in Grafana. We keep our events in the PostgreSQL database, but you can use any storage!

### Events Duration

Events can be instantaneous, has duration, multi-day and ongoing.

- If the event has only the Start time field configured, events are considered instantaneous.
- If the event has Start and End time fields configured, events are considered to have a duration.
- Any events that have an End time field configured and equal NULL are considered ongoing.

## Multi-day events

We improved aligning of multi-day events. In the latest version events are aligned weekly, which helps avoid gaps in-between for events longer than a week.

The oldest events are always on the top.

## Event colors

We improved color options for the events. If the color field is not specific events can be colored based on the Frame or Events id.

You can also choose a Color scheme in the Standard options.

## Event details

Events details were improved to split comma-separated values in the labels field. The description values support HTML elements for formatting.
