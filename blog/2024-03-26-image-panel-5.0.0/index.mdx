## Grafana 11

This is a breaking change. Our plugins always follow the latest Grafana versions and stay compatible with the most recent releases. That means, however, that we have to sunset the support of obsolete releases.
The newest Base64 5.0.0 is fully aligned with any Grafana starting from the 10.4.1 release.

## Customize the No Results message

We added a new option where you can specify a message to display instead of the image in case of loading problems. By default, the message says "Nothing to display..."

## Infinity play option

This new option allows you to play video/audio files in an endless loop.

## File Upload video

Below is one of our YouTube videos with a use-case review. It features three open-source plugins (the Data Manipulation plugin, Variable panel and Base64 panel) that come together on one Grafana dashboard to provide a solution for a long-standing task - file upload using a Grafana dashboard and immediate display of the uploaded files.

The Base64 plugin is an essential element in this example.
