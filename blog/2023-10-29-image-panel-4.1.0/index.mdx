## Image Scale Algorithm

We added a new section **Image** with one drop-down parameter **Scale Algorithm** to specify how scaling of the image should be done. 
We have three options to choose from. 

**Auto**. A browser chooses the best available algorithm.

**Crisp Edges**. The image is scaled with an algorithm that preserves contrast and edges in the image. Generally intended for images such as pixel art or line drawings, no blurring or color smoothing occurs. 

:::info
 **Crisp Edges** is a beta option in CSS and is not supported by all browsers.
:::

**Pixelated**. The image is scaled with the "nearest neighbor" or similar algorithm, preserving a "pixelated" look as the image changes in size.
