### Breaking Changes

This release requires Grafana version **11.5** or higher. Please ensure your Grafana instance is updated before installing this version.

## LLM App Link Integration

We’ve added integration with Large Language Model Application (LLM App), enabling seamless linking to AI-powered tools directly from Business Links. This feature enables users to leverage business intelligence and AI capabilities within their Grafana environment, streamlining workflows and enhancing decision-making processes.

Whether you're analyzing data or generating insights, connecting to LLM apps has never been easier.

## Improved Sticky Positioning Recalculation

We’ve enhanced the sticky positioning functionality to recalculate positions dynamically when the window is resized. This improvement ensures better layout stability, preventing elements from overlapping or misaligning during resizing events.

Users will notice a smoother and more consistent experience, especially on responsive layouts.

## Dynamic Menu Font Size

To improve readability and adaptability across different devices and screen sizes, we’ve updated the font size of dynamic menus.

This change ensures that text remains clear and legible, whether you’re viewing Business Links on a large monitor or a smaller device, providing a more accessible and user-friendly interface.

## Kiosk Mode Support

Business Links 2.0.0 now supports kiosk mode, allowing users to enable a full-screen, distraction-free experience. This is ideal for environments where dashboards need to be displayed continuously, such as in control rooms or public displays.

Kiosk mode ensures that only the essential content is visible, removing unnecessary UI elements for maximum focus.

## Hide Tooltip Option

For users seeking a cleaner and more minimalistic interface, we’ve introduced an option to hide tooltips. This customization allows you to reduce visual clutter and tailor the navigation panel to your preferences, ensuring a more focused and streamlined user experience.
