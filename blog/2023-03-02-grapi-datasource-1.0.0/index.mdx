# Grafana HTTP API Data Source 1.0.0

A new plugin Grafana HTTP API Data Source 1.0.0 was released today. This first release

- Allows connecting to Local and Remote Grafana instances via HTTP API using API Keys and Tokens.
- Tested with Grafana HTTP API versions 8.5+. It may work with previous versions.
- Allows retrieving Health information, Annotations, Alerts, and Data Sources.

:::info Grafana Catalog

## Why?

Imagine you have many Grafana instances and you want to

- Quickly check information, configuration and usage reports from all of them.
- Validate users and teams across all instances.
- Display annotations collected from many instances on a Time Series panel.

Even if you have a single Grafana instance and you want to display Alerting Annotations filtered by variable on a Time Series panel, which was one of the reasons we created this data source. We will discuss this use case in the upcoming blog.

## First release

This is the first release of the Grafana HTTP API Data Source. It is a game-changer to retrieve annotations, check health information, and verify the configuration of the local and remote Grafana instances, including Grafana Cloud.

Grafana HTTP API requires API Key or Token to access local and remote instances.
