## Multi-Select

A new multi-select box is similar to the select box and allows selecting multiple options.

## Conditional element visibility

The new **Show If** option available for any form element allows you to control the visibility of the form element depending on other elements' values. The JavaScript function should return `true` to show the element or `false` to hide it.

For example, this form element is shown only if the selected value for the `select` element is equal to `max`.

```js
const select = elements.find((element) => element.id === "select");

if (select) {
  return select.value === "max";
}
```

## Custom payload code editor

### Initial request with Data Source

The code editor for the custom payload is available for initial requests using the data source. When the data source is selected, you can specify a custom payload to execute the `rawSql` SQL statement and any other property required for a specific data source.

```javascript
return {
  rawSql: "",
  format: "table",
};
```

A response from the data source can be manually parsed in the custom code using the `toDataQueryResponse()` function, which returns data frames. Values from the data frames can be applied to the form elements as described in the documentation.

```javascript
const dataQuery = toDataQueryResponse(response);
console.log(dataQuery);
```

/>

### Update request

In the update request, you can send the payload as follows:

- All Elements
- Updated only
- Custom Code

In the **Custom Code** section, you can create your own logic to form a payload.

```javascript
const payload = {};

elements.forEach((element) => {
  if (!element.value) {
    return;
  }

  payload[element.id] = element.value;
});

return payload;

/**
 * Data Source payload
 */
return {
  rawSql: "",
  format: "table",
};
```

<Image
  title="Update request can send all, updated elements, and a custom payload."
  src="/img/blog/2023-08-23-form-panel-3.1.0/update.png"
/>

## Code editor Custom reset

The Reset button enables adding custom logic in the JavaScript code editor. By default, it calls the initial request.

/>

## Data Source request

Support for data sources was one of the most requested community features. Since version 3.1.0, you don't need a REST API server to interact with databases and storages configured as data sources.

### Initial Request

Response from the initial request can be parsed manually as demonstrated above or automatically assigned to the form elements.

To get the latest value of any field returned from the data source, provide the field name and send it in the payload to update.

  src="/img/blog/2023-08-23-form-panel-3.1.0/fieldname.png"
/>

### Update Request

The update request payload for the data source should be created in the custom code according to the data source specification. For SQL databases, it's `rawSql` and `format`:

```javascript
const payload = {};

elements.forEach((element) => {
  if (!element.value) {
    return;
  }

  payload[element.id] = element.value;
});

/**
 * Data Source payload
 */
return {
  rawSql: "",
  format: "table",
};
```

/>

## onChange to update elements in the local state

In Data Manipulation Panel 3.X, the `onChange()` function is required to manually update the form element's values in the local state.

```js
onChange(elements.map((element) => {
  return element.id === 'name' ? { ...element, value: 'test' } : element;
});
```

## Getting Started

You can install Data Manipulation Panel from the [Grafana Plugins catalog](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/volkovlabs-form-panel/) or using the Grafana command line tool.

For the latter, please use the following command:

```bash
grafana-cli plugins install volkovlabs-form-panel
```

## YouTube Tutorial

Data Manipulation Panel is a brand-new Grafana plugin. It is the first plugin that allows you to insert and update application data, as well as modify settings, straight from your Grafana dashboard.
