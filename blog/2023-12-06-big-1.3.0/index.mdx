# Business Intelligence App 1.3.0

We are excited to announce the release of the Business Intelligence App, version 1.3.0. At this early stage, it is a proof-of-concept, meaning a product created as a starter to vastly extend its functionality in the future. This release includes the following updates:

- Improved the Alerting panel with Grafana user roles.
- Updated thresholds range to evaluate alerts.
- Added support for transformations and multi-frames.
- Added retry and timeout for Grafana health check.

## User roles in Alerting panel

The latest version of the Alerting panel supports user roles.

## Threshold range

## Transformations and Multi-frames

## Grafana Health Check

To access dashboard configuration in Grafana and create Annotations Engine requires Grafana token and URL to connect to.

When Engine start ups it will check Grafana instance availability. If engine and Grafana start up the same time we added number of retries and timeout parameters to validate connection.

```
##
## Service Account
## - Viewer permission is required to access dashboards
## - Editor permission is required to access dashboards and add Annotations
##
GRAFANA_TOKEN=SERVICE-ACCOUNT-TOKEN

##
## Grafana HTTP API
##
GRAFANA_URL=http://grafana:3000

##
## Grafana Health-Check timeout, ms
## Waiting for Grafana availability for (Timeout * Number of Retries / 1000 ) seconds
##
GRAFANA_HEALTH_CHECK_TIMEOUT=1000

##
## Grafana Health-Check number of retries
##
GRAFANA_HEALTH_CHECK_RETRY=5
```

## Getting Started

You can download the Proof of Concept from our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/volkovlabs/volkovlabs-bi-grafana).

### Docker Compose

The `docker-compose.yml` file consists of the following containers:

- **Grafana** includes the provisioned BI Engine data source, an Alerting panel, and a demo dashboard.
- **Timescale** is required to store configuration, events, rules, etc.
- **BI Engine** has a service account key to access Grafana HTTP APIs. It evaluates alert rules and calls webhooks when alert statuses change.
- **JSON webhook** is a webhook example based on NodeJS, which accepts alert payload and saves it to the files for testing purposes.
- **Node-RED** provides an HTTP POST endpoint and sends a Slack notification with alert details.
- **Data Generator** generates test data for threshold evaluation in the demo dashboard.

### Start

When you run a docker-compose file, it launches the Grafana, Timescale, BI Engine and Webhook containers:

```
docker compose pull && docker compose up
```

### Stop

Stop and remove all containers:

```
docker compose down
```
