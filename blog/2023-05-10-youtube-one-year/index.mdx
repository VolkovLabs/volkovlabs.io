# Our YouTube Channel is 1 year

Our channel has been successfully assisting the community for a year now by providing efficient guidance on the usage of the Grafana platform and our plugins.

Despite our lack of prior experience in managing a YouTube channel, we have continuously improved by taking into account valuable feedback from the community. Additionally, we have made it a point to address the most commonly asked community questions that are not easily accessible elsewhere.

We share daily updates in the [YouTube Community](https://www.youtube.com/@volkovlabs/community), which becomes our primary channel of communication.

## Concept

Before diving into how to do something, Daria likes to explore, provide a schema of Grafana things and visualize how various parts interact and coexist with each other.

<table>
  <tr style={{ border: "none" }}>
    <td width="50%" style={{ border: "none" }}>
      <Video
        title="Magic JavaScript trio for Grafana. Dynamic Text, Data Manipulation and Apache ECharts plugins."
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wPr4gZYzUVA"
        height={250}
      />
    </td>
    <td width="*" style={{ border: "none" }}>
      <Video
        title="Annotations, Alerts, and Annotation queries in Grafana explained."

      />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Tutorials

Tutorials are the backbone of our channel.
