# Celebrate with us! Our YouTube Channel is 1 year!

After one year, we are proud to look back and descry what we have accomplished.  

Our channel has been successfully assisting the community this past year by providing efficient guidance on the usage of the Grafana platform and our open-source plugins.

Despite the lack of prior experience in managing a YouTube channel, we have continuously improved by taking into account valuable feedback from the community. Additionally, we have made it a point to address the most commonly asked community questions that are not easily accessible elsewhere.

Following our zeal, we created a platform for spreading technical knowledge and earning a trustworthy reputation.

We are on the lookout for the best ways to interact with the community and our followers. For the daily updates and quick surveys, we favor the [YouTube Community](https://www.youtube.com/@volkovlabs/community) at this time. 
Many people reacted to the post about a new panel idea. A panel to provide movable real estate for displaying variables. That hints us to move the creation of this panel up in our to-do list and possibly consider a video or at least an article with a sound use case.

Even though we are completely focused on the technical side of things, many people like our behind the scene photographs. That is honestly a surprising observation, but we take it too.

After being Grafana story-tellers for that long, we came up with three areas that we are particularly good at and would like to grow more towards:
 - Concepts.
 - Tutorials.
 - Use cases.

## Concept

Before diving into a new topic and creating a step-by-step tutorial, Daria likes to look at the system architecture from up high and understand how all parts interact and coexist with each other. As a result, most of the time, she comes up with an astonishing schema that explains far from trivial processes.

As a nice bonus, her schemas are great memory refreshers when you go back to the subject after being focused on something else. 

<table>
  <tr style={{ border: "none" }}>
    <td width="50%" style={{ border: "none" }}>
      <Video
        title="Magic JavaScript trio for Grafana. Dynamic Text, Data Manipulation and Apache ECharts plugins."
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wPr4gZYzUVA"
        height={250}
      />
    </td>
    <td width="*" style={{ border: "none" }}>
      <Video
        title="Annotations, Alerts, and Annotation queries in Grafana explained."

        height={250}
      />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Tutorials and use cases

Tutorials are the backbone of our channel. Those videos get the most views and questions. We always try to find relevant to many scenarios and ensure anyone can follow along and learn the topic as they go.

<table>
  <tr style={{ border: "none" }}>
    <td width="50%" style={{ border: "none" }}>
      <Video
        title="Create your Business Grafana dashboard. Step-by-step tutorial for analysts."
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HNCKbGfAU0Q"
        height={250}
      />
    </td>
    <td width="*" style={{ border: "none" }}>
      <Video
        title="Apache ECharts panel for Grafana. How to create modern dashboards in Grafana."
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DxqCrBEmrQw"
        height={250}
      />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Some tutorials are best when done on solid use cases. Anything that Daria explains you can easily recreate on your side. A lot of pieces can be downloaded from our GitHub organization. And be certain, all your questions are going to be answered!

  <tr style={{ border: "none" }}>
    <td width="50%" style={{ border: "none" }}>
      <Video
        title="Build a Website Analytics dashboard in Grafana."

        height={250}
      />
    </td>
    <td width="*" style={{ border: "none" }}>
      <Video
        title="How to display the unemployment rate."
