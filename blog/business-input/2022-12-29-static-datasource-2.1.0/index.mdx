# Business Input 2.1.0

We are happy to announce the release of the Static Data Source 2.1.0. This release includes the following updates:

- Finished refactoring.
- Updated to the latest Grafana toolkit 9.3.2.
- Introduced new features for the `Time`, `Number`, and `String` fields.

The Static Data Source was initially developed and positioned to create data for testing and developing new plugins. Still, there is another compelling use case for storing data inside the dashboard, which we see utilized by the community.
