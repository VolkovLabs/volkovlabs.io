# Dynamic Text Panel 4.0.0

We're excited to announce the release of the Dynamic Text Panel 4.0.0. This major release includes the following updates:

- Requires Grafana 9 or Grafana 10.
- Added the Event Bus object into JavaScript functions.
- Added support for dashboard variables in CSS styles.
- Added compatibility with Grafana 10.0.0 and deprecated support for Grafana 8.5.

:::info Grafana Plugins catalog

## 3 million downloads

We celebrated 2 million downloads in February. The panel's adaptability has been extremely accelerated since then.

JavaScript code, a CSS style editor, and Grafana events offer functionalities that no native or community plugin has yet to provide.

## Dashboard variables

Dynamic Text Panel provides helpers to support variables. You can also use variables in JavaScript code and CSS styles.

### JavaScript code

Use the `replaceVariables` function to replace dashboard variables in the JavaScript code.

```
const bonjour = replaceVariables("${variable}");
console.log(bonjour.toUpperCase())
```

### Styles

Dashboard variables are replaced automatically in CSS styles.

### Content

Returns a string array of the currently selected values for a certain variable.

```handlebars
{{variable "hostname"}}

<!-- result: ['server1', 'server2', 'server3']  -->
```

You can find more examples in our [documentation](/plugins/volkovlabs-dynamictext-panel/variables/).

## Event Bus

Grafana uses an event bus to publish application events to notify different parts of Grafana when the user interacts with it. Dynamic Text Panel can respond to these interactions by subscribing to one or more events.

### Predefined Events

A full list of events is available in our [Grafana Crash Course](/grafana/developer/eventbus).

### Subscribe to events

To avoid memory leaks, all events must be unsubscribed.

```
const subscription = eventBus.subscribe({ type: 'data-hover' }, () => {
  console.log('React to Data Hover')
})

return () => {
  subscription.unsubscribe();
  console.log('Unsubscribed');
}
```

## Getting Started

You can install Dynamic Text Panel from the [Grafana Plugins catalog](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/marcusolsson-dynamictext-panel/) or using the Grafana command line tool.

For the latter, please use the following command:

```bash
grafana-cli plugins install marcusolsson-dynamictext-panel
```

## YouTube Tutorial

Dynamic Text Panel is a Grafana visualization plugin that converts plain text and table data into visually appealing, easy-to-read information cards. You can use variables, Markdown, and Handlebars to customize the look of the outputted cards.

The Dynamic Text Panel plugin allows you to construct a text visualization template from the values of a dataset returned by a data source query.
