## Dashboard variables

The Dynamic Text panel provides helpers to support variables. Variables can also be used in the JavaScript code and CSS styles.

### JavaScript code

Use `replaceVariables` to replace dashboard variables in the JavaScript code.

```
const bonjour = replaceVariables("${variable}");
console.log(bonjour.toUpperCase())
```

### Styles

Dashboard variables are replaced automatically in the CSS styles.

### Content

Returns a string array of the currently selected values for a certain variable.

```handlebars
{{variable "hostname"}}

<!-- result: ['server1', 'server2', 'server3']  -->
```

More examples are in the [documentation](/plugins/volkovlabs-dynamictext-panel/variables/).

## Event Bus

Grafana uses an event bus to publish application events to notify different parts of Grafana when the user acts. Dynamic Text panel can react to these actions by subscribing to one or more events.

### Predefined Events

A full list of events is available in the [Grafana Crash Course](/grafana/developer/eventbus).

### Subscribe to events

To avoid memory leaks all events must be unsubscribed.

```
const subscription = eventBus.subscribe({ type: 'data-hover' }, () => {
  console.log('React to Data Hover')
})

return () => {
  subscription.unsubscribe();
  console.log('Unsubscribed');
}
```

## YouTube Tutorial

A Dynamic Text visualization panel is a Grafana plugin that transforms monotone text/table data into vibrant, easy-to-read information cards. The panel supports variables, Markdown and Handlebars.

The Dynamic Text visualization panel lets you define a text template using the data from your data source query.
