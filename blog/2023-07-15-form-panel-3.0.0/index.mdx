The refactoring of local states and form elements may introduce breaking changes. Please test this version before updating the plugin on production Grafana instances.

## 85,000 downloads

This year, we are seeing growing community interest in data manipulation and are trying to deliver the backlog items and requested features as fast as possible.

The plugin was downloaded more than 85,000 times and we aim at the 100,000 downloads milestone.

## Elements

Form elements in the panel's options were placed into new collapsible components and received support for drag-and-drop support and delayed auto-save.

To improve performance, we added the delayed saving of form elements. Form elements are automatically saved after a one-second timeout or when clicking the Save button to prevent numerous updates when creating new forms.

## Sections

Form elements can be separated into sections. In addition to the landscape orientation, we added the portrait orientation, which can be selected in the plugin options.

## Hidden strings

We added an option to hide the string input, which can store additional information that is not visible to end-users.
