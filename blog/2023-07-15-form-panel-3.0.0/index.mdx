## Elements

Elements in panel options were updated with new collapsable components, drag-and-drop support and delayed auto-save.

To improve performance we added delayed saving of form elements. Form elements will be auto-saved after a 1-second timeout or when clicking on the save button to prevent numerous updates when creating new forms.

## Sections

Form elements can be separated into sections. In addition to horizontal, we added vertical section orientation, which can be selected in the panel options.

## Hidden strings

We added an option to hide string input, which can store additional information not shown to the users.
