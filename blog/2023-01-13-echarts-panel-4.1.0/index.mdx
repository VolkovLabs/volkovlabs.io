# Apache ECharts Panel 4.1.0

We are happy to announce the release of the Apache ECharts Panel 4.1.0 for Grafana. This release includes the following updates:

- Added support for streaming for WebSockets and Grafana Live.
- Added the Data Zoom feature updating a time range similar to the TimeSeries panel.
- Updated the product documentation answering community questions.

## Streaming

Streaming enables real-time data updates using streaming data sources and Grafana Live. You can find examples and configurations in [our documentation](/plugins/volkovlabs-echarts-panel/streaming).

### Grafana Live

Grafana Live is a real-time messaging engine introduced in Grafana v8.0. With Grafana Live, you can push event data to a frontend as soon as an event occurs.

### WebSocket API

To stream real-time data, we used the [WebSocket data source for Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/golioth-websocket-datasource/).

## Data Zoom feature

The Data Zoom feature allows you to select a time period on the chart for zooming in. Once the time range is selected, the event can update the time range on the dashboard using the `locationService` parameter, similar to native Grafana behavior.

You can find the code snippet in the [Event Handling](/plugins/volkovlabs-echarts-panel/events) section.

## Getting Started

You can install Apache ECharts Panel from the [Grafana Plugins catalog](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/volkovlabs-echarts-panel/) or using the Grafana command line tool.

For the latter, please use the following command.

```bash
grafana-cli plugins install volkovlabs-echarts-panel
```

## YouTube Tutorial

The Apache ECharts Panel plugin is a data visualization extension for Grafana that allows you to integrate charts and graphs from the popular Apache ECharts library into your Grafana dashboard.
