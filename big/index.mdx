# Business Intelligence

:::info Public Preview
The Business Intelligence platform is under active development. Public Preview releases are available exclusively for testing purposes.
:::

Born from close collaboration with the Grafana Community and real-world production challenges, the Business Intelligence platform reimagines alerting and analytics in Grafana.

Users sought simpler interactions, centralized controls, and advanced features like anomaly detection and reporting for self-hosted Grafana instances. After extensive brainstorming and feedback, we’ve designed a modular, user-friendly solution that’s easy to maintain and poised for future growth.

## Architecture

/>

The Business Intelligence platform comprises:

- **Business Studio**

  - Your central control panel.
  - Offers a user-friendly interface with a system-wide overview.
  - Requires only one instance to manage the entire platform.

- **Business Engine**

  - Powers one Grafana instance per engine.
  - Handles heavy computation and task execution.

- **Business Alerting**

  - The first available Business Engine module.
  - Provides alert systems driven by Grafana panel queries, supporting customizable thresholds and variables for timely business metric notifications.

- **Business Reporting**

  - An upcoming Business Engine module (stay tuned!).

- **Future Modules**

  - Includes anomaly detection and more in development.

- **Grafana Integration**
  - Works with any Grafana type (OSS, Enterprise, or Cloud)—Grafana itself is not included.

This architecture empowers users to:

- Manage multiple Grafana instances from a single Business Studio.
- Enjoy an intuitive interface.
- Integrate seamlessly with upcoming Business Engine features, like version control and dashboard propagation.

## User Experience

Business Studio caters to two user types—**Business** and **Technical**:

- **Business Users**: Sleek, simplified interfaces for internal teams or customers. Focus on creating alert rules, actions, and quick analysis to flag critical issues.
- **Technical Users**: Advanced tools for troubleshooting, including payloads and Grafana data frames. Ideal for users comfortable with clusters and Grafana internals.
