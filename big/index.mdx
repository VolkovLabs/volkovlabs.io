# Business Intelligence

Developed in collaboration with the Grafana Community and shaped by real-world production needs, the Business Intelligence platform redefines alerting and analytics within Grafana.

Users expressed a need for streamlined interactions, centralized management, and advanced capabilities like anomaly detection and reporting in self-hosted Grafana environments. Through iterative design and community input, we’ve crafted a modular, intuitive solution that’s both maintainable and scalable.

## Architecture

/>

The Business Intelligence platform consists of the following components:

- **Business Studio**

  - Centralized management hub
  - Provides a user-friendly interface with a comprehensive system overview
  - Requires only one instance to oversee the entire platform

- **Business Engine**

  - Drives performance for a single Grafana instance per engine
  - Executes computationally intensive tasks and processes

- **Business Alerting**

  - Initial module for the Business Engine
  - Enables query-driven alerts from Grafana panels with customizable thresholds and variables for timely metric notifications

- **Business Reporting**

  - Upcoming module for the Business Engine (in development)

- **Future Modules**

  - Planned features include anomaly detection and additional capabilities

- **Grafana Integration**
  - Compatible with all Grafana variants (OSS, Enterprise, Cloud)—Grafana itself is not bundled

This architecture delivers:

- Unified management of multiple Grafana instances via a single Business Studio
- An accessible, intuitive interface
- Seamless integration with future Business Engine enhancements, such as version control and dashboard synchronization

## User Experience

Business Studio supports two distinct user personas:

- **Business Users**

  - Simplified, elegant interfaces tailored for internal teams or clients
  - Emphasis on creating alert rules, defining actions, and performing rapid analysis to highlight critical issues

- **Technical Users**
  - Robust tools for in-depth troubleshooting, including access to payloads and Grafana data frames
  - Suited for users familiar with clusters and Grafana’s technical underpinnings
