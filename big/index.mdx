# Business Intelligence Platform

Welcome to the **Business Intelligence (BI) Platform**, a powerful solution developed in collaboration with the Grafana Community. Designed to meet real-world production needs, this platform transforms alerting and analytics within Grafana by offering streamlined interactions, centralized management, and advanced features like anomaly detection and reporting.

Whether you're a business user seeking simplicity or a technical expert needing robust tools, our modular and scalable platform integrates seamlessly with all Grafana variants (OSS, Enterprise, Cloud). Ready to redefine your Grafana experience? Let's dive in!

## Why Choose Our BI Platform?

Users of self-hosted Grafana environments often face challenges with fragmented tools and limited advanced capabilities. Through iterative design and community feedback, we've built a solution that addresses these pain points with:

- **Unified Management**: Oversee multiple Grafana instances from a single hub.
- **Intuitive Design**: User-friendly interfaces for all skill levels.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Modular components that grow with your needs.

Our platform is composed of modular components designed for flexibility and performance:

- [**Business Studio**](studio/): A centralized management hub with a user-friendly interface for system-wide oversight. Only one instance is needed to manage the entire platform.

- [**Business Engine**](engine/): Powers performance for individual Grafana instances, handling computationally intensive tasks. Each engine supports a single Grafana instance.

- [**Business Alerting**](alerting/): The first module for the Business Engine, enabling query-driven alerts from Grafana panels with customizable thresholds and variables for timely notifications.

- **Business Reporting**: An upcoming module (in development) to enhance data insights and reporting capabilities.

- **Future Modules**: Planned features include anomaly detection and more innovative tools to expand functionality.

- **Grafana Integration**: Fully compatible with all Grafana variants (OSS, Enterprise, Cloud). Note that Grafana itself is not bundled with the platform.

## Tailored User Experiences

The Business Studio is designed to cater to two distinct user personas with specialized interfaces and tools:

### Business Users

- **Simplified Interfaces**: Elegant dashboards tailored for internal teams or clients.
- **Key Focus**: Create alert rules, define actions, and perform rapid analysis to identify critical issues.

### Technical Users

- **Advanced Tools**: In-depth troubleshooting with access to payloads and Grafana data frames.
- **Target Audience**: Ideal for users familiar with clusters and Grafanaâ€™s technical architecture.
