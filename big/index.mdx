# Business Intelligence

While working closely with the Community and helping to solve production use cases, we have accumulated quite a list of wishes for reimagined alerting functioning.

Most asks were related to simplifying user interaction by possibly having all controls in one UI place. Many users were eager to incorporate anomaly detection with reporting for self-hosted Grafana.

This is how the idea of the Business Intelligence platform was born.

## Features

- **[High-Performance Business Engine](engine)**: Delivers robust performance with distributed load balancing and high availability, integrating seamlessly with Grafana.
- **User-Friendly Business Studio**: Simplifies management of Business Engines, allowing non-technical users to configure, monitor, and maintain data workflows.
- **[Advanced Business Alerts](alerting)**: Features alert systems based on Grafana panel queries, with support for customizable thresholds and variables, ensuring timely and relevant notifications for business metrics.
