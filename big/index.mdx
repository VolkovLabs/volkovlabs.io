# Business Intelligence

While working closely with the Community and helping to solve production use cases, we have accumulated quite a list of wishes for reimagined alerting functioning.

Most asks were related to simplifying user interaction by possibly having all controls in one UI place. Many users were eager to incorporate forecasting paired with AI for self-hosted Grafana.

This is how the idea of the Business Intelligence for Grafana BI(G) was born. With the general thought of making alerting accessible for business users.
