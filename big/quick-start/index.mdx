## Docker Compose Configuration

Configure a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following containers:

- **Timescale**: Manages Business Engine configuration data (use an existing Timescale database or Timescale Cloud if available)
- **Business Engine**: Connects to Grafana via a service account token, leveraging HTTP APIs to fetch configurations, evaluate alert rules, and execute actions
