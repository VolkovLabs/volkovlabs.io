# Quick Start Guide

This Quick Start Guide outlines the essential steps to deploy the Business Intelligence platform using an existing Grafana LGTM (Loki, Grafana, Tempo, Mimir) stack and production data.

:::info Grafana 11 and 12 Requirement
The Business Engine requires Grafana version 11 or later and is compatible with the latest Grafana releases running in Grafana Cloud.
:::

## Docker Compose Configuration

Set up a `docker-compose.yml` file to define the necessary services for the Business Intelligence platform. The configuration includes the following containers:

- **PostgreSQL**: Stores Business Engine configuration data.
- **Business Engine**: Connects to a single Grafana instance using a service account token.
  - Utilizes HTTP APIs to retrieve configurations, evaluate alert rules, and execute actions.
  - Requires username and password for Image Render Microservice to access Grafana UI.
- **Node-RED (Optional)**: Provides workflow to send email, Slack notifications, open Grafana Incident, etc.
- **Grafana Alloy (Optional)**: Allows to collect metrics and logs from Business Engine.

## Starting the Platform

Follow these steps to deploy and launch the Business Intelligence platform:

1. **Access Grafana**: Log in to your Grafana instance (Cloud, OSS, or Enterprise).

2. **Create a Service Account**: Set up a service account in Grafana with **Viewer** or **Editor** permissions to allow the Business Engine to interact with Grafana APIs. **Editor** permission is required to create Annotations.

3. **Start Containers**: Launch the Business Engine and PostgresSQL containers using Docker Compose. Node-RED and Grafana Alloy are optional for actions workflow and metrics, logs collection.

   ```sh
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. **Install Business Studio**: Download the Business Studio application from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/VolkovLabs/business-intelligence/releases), then install and open it.

5. **Configure Business Engine**: Add the Business Engine in Business Studio to define actions, set up alert rules, and schedule reports:

## Stopping the Platform

To stop and remove all running containers, execute the following command:

```sh
docker compose down
```
