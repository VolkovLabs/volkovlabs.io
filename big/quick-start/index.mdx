:::info Grafana 11

The Business Engine requires Grafana 11. The Business Intelligence platform will always be compatible with the current Grafana version.
:::

## Docker Compose configuration

Create `docker-compose.yml` file with the following containers:

- **Timescale** database stores Business Engine configuration data. If you have existing Timescale database or Timescale Cloud instance you can use them to store Business Engine configuration.
- **Business Engine** uses a service account key to access Grafana HTTP APIs to extract necessary configurations. It evaluates alert rules and calls actions.

```yml
services:
  timescale:
    image: timescale/timescaledb:latest-pg14
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
    ports:
      - 5432:5432

  engine:
    depends_on:
      - timescale
    image: ghcr.io/volkovlabs/business-engine:2.5.1
    #env_file: .env
    environment:
      DATABASE_HOST: timescale
      DATABASE_PORT: 5432
      DATABASE_DB: postgres
      DATABASE_USERNAME: postgres
      DATABASE_PASSWORD: postgres
      #GRAFANA_URL: https://MY-ACCOUNT.grafana.net
      #GRAFANA_TOKEN: SERVICE-ACCOUNT-TOKEN
    ports:
      - 3001:3001
      - 3002:3002
```

## Start the platform

1. Login to your Grafana Cloud, OSS or Enterprise instance.
2. Create a service account with the `Viewer` or `Editor` role.
3. (optional) Update `GRAFANA_URL` and `GRAFANA_TOKEN` in the `docker-compose.yml` file

4. Start the Business Engine and Timescale database.

```
docker compose up -d
```

5. Download the Business Studio from [Release Notes](../release). Then, install and launch it.
6. Add Business Engine in Business Studio to configure Grafana instance, actions and alert rules.

```
