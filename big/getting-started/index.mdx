# Getting Started

The Business Intelligence platform leverages Docker containers for modularity and scalability. This guide presents a comprehensive setup that integrates the platform with additional tools to simulate a near-real-world scenario. For a simpler introduction, refer to the [Quick Start](/big/quick-start/) section.

Follow these steps to replicate this setup in your environment, then adapt as needed.

:::info Grafana 11
The Business Engine requires Grafana 11. The platform maintains compatibility with the latest Grafana version.
:::

## Solution Overview

<Image

  src="/img/big/getting-started/overview.png"
/>

Once configured, this solution provides:

- **Business Studio**: A central interface to manage Business Engines, alert rules, actions, and configurations
- **Grafana Instance**: Preconfigured with three dashboards:
  - Business Engine performance metrics
  - Two dashboards for production data

## Tutorial Video

Daria walks through the installation process and demonstrates creating your first alert action and linking it to an alert rule.

## Docker Containers

Download all required Docker containers configuration from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/volkovlabs/business-intelligence).

<Image
  title="Download Configuration from GitHub"
  src="/img/big/getting-started/github-where-download.png"
/>

The downloaded package includes a `docker-compose.yml` file with these containers:

- **Grafana**: Preprovisioned with dashboards and data sources
- **Timescale**: Stores Business Engine configuration and production data
- **Data Emulator**: Node.js script generating sample production data, also demonstrating variable functionality
- **Prometheus**: Collects and stores Business Engine performance metrics
- **JSON Server**: Node.js-based action example, saving alert payloads to files
- **Business Engine**: Uses a service account token to access Grafana HTTP APIs, evaluate alert rules, and trigger actions

Here’s the `docker-compose.yml` file for reference (no need to copy—it’s in the downloaded package):

<Code
  url="https://github.com/VolkovLabs/business-intelligence/blob/main/docker-compose.yml"
  language="yaml"
/>

## Starting the Platform

After downloading the package, navigate to its directory and follow these steps.

### Grafana

1. Launch the Grafana container:
   ```bash
   docker compose --profile grafana up -d
   ```

<Image
  title="Grafana Container Running"
  src="/img/big/getting-started/grafana-container-installed.png"
/>

2. Access Grafana at:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

   Log in with username `admin` and password `admin`.

3. Create a service account with `Viewer` or `Editor` role (`Editor` enables annotations):

   <Image
     title="Create a Service Account"
     src="/img/big/getting-started/sa.png"
   />

4. Generate a token:

   <Image
     title="Generate a Service Account Token"
     src="/img/big/getting-started/token.png"
   />

5. Update the `GRAFANA_TOKEN` in `docker-compose.yml`:
   <Image
     title="Update GRAFANA_TOKEN in docker-compose.yml"
     src="/img/big/getting-started/token-yml.png"
   />

:::note Version 2.4.0
Starting with version 2.4.0, configure Grafana token and
URL directly in Business Studio, bypassing environment variable edits.
:::

### Business Engine, Timescale, and Prometheus

6. Start these containers using the `engine` profile:
   ```bash
   docker compose --profile engine up -d
   ```

### JSON Server (Optional)

7. Launch the JSON Server to test action triggers (optional, but recommended):
   ```bash
   docker compose --profile actions up -d
   ```
   This enables saving alert payloads to log files, explored later.

### Business Studio

8. Download Business Studio from the [Release Notes](../release), then install and open it.

## Working with the Platform

### Business Studio

Configure actions and alert rules:

- Set up an HTTP Request Action using `http://json-server:3000` (if started) to log events and messages
- Use the preprovisioned `Test Dashboard` to create alert rules with thresholds and regex patterns
  <Image
    title="Alert Rules Configured via Business Studio"
    src="/img/big/business-studio/alerts.png"
  />

### Grafana Dashboards

Access three preprovisioned dashboards in Grafana:

<Image
  title="Three Preprovisioned Dashboards in Grafana"
  src="/img/big/getting-started/3-dashboards.png"
/>

### Business Engine Dashboard

Displays metrics collected by Prometheus, filterable by **instance** and **alert rule** variables:

<Image
  title="Dashboard Variables for Filtering"
  src="/img/big/getting-started/instance-alert.png"
/>

#### Rows of Analytics:

1. **Alerts**:

   - Alert Results
   - Alert Latency
     <Image
       title="Alerts Analytics"
       src="/img/big/getting-started/alerts.png"
     />

2. **Requests**:

   - Business Engine API Requests
   - Business Engine Latency
   - Grafana API Requests
   - Grafana Latency
     <Image
       title="Requests Analytics"
       src="/img/big/getting-started/requests.png"
     />

3. **Processes**:
   - CPU Usage
   - Event Loop Lag
   - Memory Usage
   - Active Handlers/Requests Total
     <Image
       title="Processes Analytics"
       src="/img/big/getting-started/processes.png"
     />

### Production Data Dashboard

Features a time-series chart of device temperatures from the Data Emulator, switchable via the **metric** variable. Thick blue lines mark alert triggers, with actions logged by the JSON Server.

  src="/img/big/getting-started/prod-data.png"
/>

### Test Dashboard

Includes a time-series chart and a log chart:

<Image title="Test Dashboard" src="/img/big/getting-started/test-dash.png" />

## Stopping the Platform

To stop and remove all containers:

```bash
docker compose --profile engine down
docker compose --profile actions down
docker compose --profile grafana down
```
