# BI Engine

We reimagined the alert manager and came up with the BI Engine:

- It supports both frontend and backend data sources.
- It uses dashboards as configuration which means it retrieves dashboard queries and thresholds and uses them as alert rule parameters. That eliminates the duplicative work when users have to enter the same specifics twice.
- It is installed in a separate container which makes the system architecture flexible.

## Data Source

To connect to the Alerting BI Engine, you need the Business Intelligence data source installed and configured.

## Multi-frames

As you know, an alert rule is created for a particular panel on a particular dashboard.

/>

The BI(G), Business Intelligence App, supports multi-frame data sets. That means that the alert rule assigned to a dashboard and panel will be applied to all data frames fetched from the connected data source.

In the picture below, the panel fetches three data frames, one for each device.

- The alert is created when at least one device temperature goes beyond the allowable range (in this example, it is device 2, yellow line).
- The alert stops ringing when the last device temperature (in this example, it is device 3, blue line) comes back into the allowable range.

## Transformations

Grafana transformations are now also supported. However, please, note, that Grafana offers a large number of transformations, hence, there is a chance that some of them will not work correctly.

:::tip

Support of Grafana transformation is in beta state. This is due to the number of existing transformations.
