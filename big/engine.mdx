# BI Engine

We reimagined the alert manager and came up with the BI Engine:

- It supports both frontend and backend data sources.
- It uses dashboards as configuration which means it retrieves dashboard queries and thresholds and uses them as alert rule parameters. That eliminates the duplicative work when users have to enter the same specifics twice.
- It is installed in a separate container which makes the system architecture flexible.

To connect to the Alerting BI Engine, you need the Business Intelligence data source installed and configured.
