# Database

We use the Timescale database for many reasons. We believe it is an ideal partner to work with Grafana.
Please refer to the following blog post and YouTube video to learn our reasoning.

In the latest available version of the Business Engine, the database schema has 8 tables as shows on the image below.

Logically, these 8 tables can be be categorized into two groups: business engine tables and alerting tables.

Alerting tables
 - `alerts`. This table contains alert rules configuration. One row for one alert rule.
 - `action_relations`. This table connects alert rules with alert actions. The same alert rule might trigger multiple actions, and vice versa; the same action might be triggered by multiple action rules.
 - `alert_conditions`.
 - `alert_events`. This table grows with every alert rule execution, which makes it the biggest table of all 8. One row per an executed alert rule.
 
 Business engine tables:

 - `environments`. This table contains environment variables. One row per one environment variable.
 - `migration`. This table is to track the database version updates, type ORM.
 - `actions`. This table contains all configured actions. One row per action. 
 - `clustering`. This table contains loads balancing configuration. The table is used if your system is configured for more than one Business Engine.
