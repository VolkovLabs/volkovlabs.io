# Prometheus

Business Engine provides Prometheus metrics for performance monitoring using ready-to-use, out-of-the-box Business Engine dashboard with all necessary metrics for kick-off the successful monitoring.

Having Prometheus monitoring built-in in the Business Engine allows you to monitor the Business Intelligence platform itself.
