# Business Engine API

## Get environment info

All environment variables are displayed on the **Environment** tab in Business Studio. In the future, we plan to allow them to be modified.

The environment info is taken by using the [GET /environment endpoint](/big/api/#tag/Environment/operation/EnvironmentController_get).

## Get timeline of alert statuses

The timeline of alerting states is a subset of all alert rule records and includes only instances where alerting state changes.

We added Business Engine API endpoint to [get timeline of alerting states](/big/api/#tag/Alert-Rules/operation/AlertsController_getHistoryTimeline).

For instance, below is the complete list of alert rule states.

```text
date                      Previous            New
1/1/25, 10:29:01 AM       OK                  Alerting
1/1/25, 10:28:01 AM       OK                  OK
1/1/25, 10:27:01 AM       OK                  OK
1/1/25, 10:26:01 AM       OK                  OK
1/1/25, 10:25:01 AM       OK                  OK
1/1/25, 10:24:01 AM       OK                  OK
```

And here is the timeline. It consists of only the records where the alerting state changes.

```text
date                      Previous            New
1/1/25, 10:29:01 AM       OK                  Alerting
```
