# Business Engine

We reimagined the Alert Manager and came up with the Business Engine:

- It uses dashboards as configuration which means it retrieves dashboard queries and thresholds and uses them as alert rule parameters. That eliminates the duplicative work when users have to enter the same specifics twice.
- It is installed as a separate container which makes the system architecture flexible.

## Multi-frames

As you know, an alert rule is created for a particular panel on a particular dashboard.

The Business Engine supports multi-frame data sets. That means that the alert rule assigned to a dashboard and panel will be applied to all data frames fetched from the connected data source.

## Transformations

:::note BETA

Support of Grafana transformation is in beta state. This is due to the number of existing transformations.
:::

Grafana transformations are supported. However, please, note, that Grafana offers a large number of transformations, hence, there is a chance that some of them will not work correctly.
