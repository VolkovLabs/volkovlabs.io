# High Availability

High Availability (HA) and load balancing are critical features for the Business Intelligence platform, consistently ranked among the most requested by users. We’ve engineered the platform from the ground up to deliver robust performance and uninterrupted service, even under demanding conditions.

Each component supports clustering—groups of mirrored servers—enabling efficient load distribution and scalability.

## Deployment

The HA architecture uses clustering and load balancing to ensure seamless operation in high-traffic scenarios:

- **Load Balancer**

  - Distributes requests across mirrored Business Engines and Grafana instances
  - Maintains accessibility during peak loads

- **Business Engine Cluster**

  - Scales horizontally with multiple identical Business Engines based on workload needs

- **Grafana Cluster**
  - Supports multiple synchronized Grafana instances tailored to your requirements

### Data Storage

Select a data storage solution that aligns with your environment. We recommend these options for optimal integration with Grafana:

- **PostgreSQL (Timescale)**

  - Manages production data, configuration, and Business Engine metadata

- **Prometheus**
  - Collects and stores performance metrics

## Prometheus Configuration

Our [Prometheus setup guide](/big/alerting/datasources/prometheus/) details HA configurations, including multi-node clustering and failover strategies.
