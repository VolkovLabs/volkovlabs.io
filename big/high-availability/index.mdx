# High Availability

One of the most requested capabilities is the High Availability(HA) and Load Balancing setup. We designed the Business Intelligence platform specifically with that in mind.

All Business Intelligence components could exist in clusters, where a cluster is a set of mirrored servers. It primarily facilitates uninterrupted service by distributing the load most efficiently.

## Deployment

- The load balancer allows efficient request distribution to facilitate uninterrupted user experience in very busy environments.
  - It expertly steers requests between mirrored business engines and Grafana instances.
- Business Engine Cluster
  - You can have as many identical Business Engines as required.
- Grafana Cluster
  - You can have as many identical Grafanas as required.

### Data storage

You can use any solution for your data storage. Our choices are:

- PostgreSQL (Timescale)
  - For production, configuration, and business engine data storage.
- Prometheus
  - For metrics collection and storage.

These are the best solutions to go hand in hand with Grafana.

## Prometheus

One of the examples we provide for [Prometheus](/big/alerting/datasources/prometheus/) describes the possible High Availability setups in detail.
