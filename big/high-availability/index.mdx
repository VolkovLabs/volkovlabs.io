# High Availability

High Availability (HA) and load balancing are among the most requested features for the Business Intelligence platform. We’ve designed it from the ground up to meet these needs, ensuring robust performance and uninterrupted service.

Each component of the platform can operate in clusters—sets of mirrored servers—optimizing load distribution for maximum efficiency.

## Deployment

The HA setup leverages clustering and load balancing to deliver a seamless experience, even in high-traffic environments:

- **Load Balancer**:

  - Distributes requests efficiently across mirrored Business Engines and Grafana instances.
  - Ensures uninterrupted access under heavy demand.

- **Business Engine Cluster**:

  - Scale with as many identical Business Engines as needed for your workload.

- **Grafana Cluster**:
  - Deploy multiple synchronized Grafana instances to match your requirements.

### Data Storage

Choose any data storage solution that fits your needs. Our recommended options pair seamlessly with Grafana:

- **PostgreSQL (Timescale)**:

  - Stores production data, configuration, and Business Engine metadata.

- **Prometheus**:
  - Handles metrics collection and storage.

## Prometheus

Our [Prometheus setup guide](/big/alerting/datasources/prometheus/) covers HA configurations, including multi-node clusters and failover strategies.
