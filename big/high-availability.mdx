# High Availability

High Availability (HA) and load balancing are essential for ensuring the reliability and performance of the Business Intelligence platform. These features, consistently among the most requested by users, are built into the platform's core design to provide uninterrupted service and robust performance, even under heavy demand.

Every component of the platform supports clustering—groups of mirrored servers—allowing for efficient load distribution and seamless scalability.

## Deployment Architecture

The HA architecture leverages clustering and load balancing to maintain smooth operation during high-traffic scenarios:

- **Load Balancer**

  - Distributes incoming requests across mirrored Business Engines and Grafana instances.
  - Ensures accessibility and performance during peak loads.

- **Business Engine Cluster**

  - Scales horizontally by adding multiple identical Business Engines to meet workload demands.
  - Business Engines provides Load-Balancing using PostgreSQL database.

- **Grafana Cluster**
  - Supports multiple synchronized Grafana instances, customizable to your specific needs.

## Data Storage Solutions

Choose a data storage solution that best fits your environment. For optimal integration with Grafana, we selected the following:

- **PostgreSQL**

  - Handles production data, configuration, and Business Engine metadata efficiently.

- **Prometheus**
  - Collects and stores performance metrics for monitoring and analysis.
