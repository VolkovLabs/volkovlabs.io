# High Availability

One of the most requested capabilities is the High Availability(HA) and Load Balancing setup. We designed the Business Intelligence platform specifically keeping that in mind.

All Business Intelligence components could exist in clusters, where a cluster is a set of mirrored servers. It is done to primarily facilitate uninterrupted service by distributing the load most efficiently.

## Deployment

- Business Engine Cluster:
  - Requests to Server API are distributed behind the Load Balancer.
  - Schedulers distribute execution of alert rules automatically.
- Grafana Cluster visualizes data and provides Grafana API for Business Engine.
- Prometheus Cluster stores Business Engine performance data.
  - May store Production metrics.
- PostgreSQL (Timescale) Cluster stores:
  - Business Engine database.
  - Grafana configuration database.
  - May store Production data.

Below is the picture to illustrate the current High Availability setup.
