# High Availability

One of the most requested capabilities is the high availability(HA) setup. We designed the BI App specifically keeping that in mind.

All BI App system components could exist in clusters, where a cluster is a set of mirrored servers. It is done to primarily facilitate uninterrupted service by distributing the load most efficiently.

## Deployment

- BI Engine Cluster:
  - Requests to Server API are distributed behind the Load Balancer.
  - Schedulers distribute alert rules automatically.
- Grafana Cluster visualizes data and provides HTTP API for BI Engine to retrieve configuration and data.
- Prometheus Cluster stores BI Engine performance data.
- PostgreSQL Cluster stores:
  - BI Engine database.
  - Grafana configuration database.
  - Production data.

Below is the picture to illustrate the current HA setup.
