# High Availability

One of the most requested capabilities is the high-availability(HA) setup. We designed the BI App specifically keeping that in mind.

All BI App system components could exist in clusters, where a cluster is a set of mirrored servers. It is done to primarily facilitate uninterrupted service by distributing the load most efficiently.

## Deployment

- BI Engine Cluster:
  - Requests to Server API are distributed behind Load Balancer.
  - Schedulers distribute alert rules automatically.
- Grafana Cluster visualizes data and provides HTTP API for BI Engine to retrieve configuration and data.
- Prometheus Cluster stores BI Engine performance data.
- PostgreSQL Cluster stores:
  - BI Engine database.
  - Grafana configuration database.
  - Production data.
