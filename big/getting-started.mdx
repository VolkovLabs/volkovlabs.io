# Getting Started

The Business Intelligence platform utilize Docker containers to be modular and scalable. The getting started Community configuration can be downloaded from [GitHub repository](https://github.com/volkovlabs/business-intelligence).

:::note Grafana 11

The Business Engine requires Grafana 11. The Business Intelligence platform will always be compatible with the most current Grafana version.
:::

## Docker containers

The `docker-compose.yml` file consists of the following containers and can be used to start the platform:

- **Grafana** includes the provisioned dashboards and data sources.
- **Timescale** is required to store Business Engine configuration.
- **Business Engine** has a service account key to access Grafana HTTP APIs. It evaluates alert rules and calls actions when alert statuses change.
- **Prometheus** collects and store performance metrics from Business Engine.
- **JSON server** is an action example based on NodeJS, which accepts alert payload and saves it to the files for testing purposes.
- **Data Emulator** is a NodeJS scripts to populate data to Timescale database and demonstrate variables functionality.

## Start the platform

### Grafana

1. Start Grafana container and login as admin with `admin` password

```
docker compose --profile grafana up -d
```

2. Create Service Account and update `GRAFANA_TOKEN` in the `docker-compose.yml` file

### Business Engine

3. Start the Business Engine, Timescale database, and Prometheus containers

```
docker compose --profile engine up -d
```

4. Start JSON Server to test Actions (optional)

```
docker compose --profile actions up -d
```

### Business Studio

5. Download and start the Business Studio from [Release Notes](../release)

6. Configure Actions and Alert Rules

- Use JSON server `http://json-server:3000` for HTTP Request Action to create event and message files when alert triggered if started.
- Use provisioned `Test Dashboard` for adding Alert Rules based on thresholds and Regex pattern.
