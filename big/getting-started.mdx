## Docker Compose

The `docker-compose.yml` file consists of the following containers:

- **Grafana** includes the provisioned BI Engine data source, an Alerting panel, and dashboards.
- **Timescale** is required to store configuration, events, rules, etc.
- **BI Engine** has a service account key to access Grafana HTTP APIs. It evaluates alert rules and calls webhooks when alert statuses change.
- **Prometheus** collects and store performance metrics from BI Engine.
- **JSON webhook** is a webhook example based on NodeJS, which accepts alert payload and saves it to the files for testing purposes.
