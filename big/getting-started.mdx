## Docker Compose

The `docker-compose.yml` file consists of the following containers:

- **Grafana** includes the provisioned BI Engine data source, an Alerting panel, and a demo dashboard.
- **Timescale** is required to store configuration, events, rules, etc.
- **BI Engine** has a service account key to access Grafana HTTP APIs. It evaluates alert rules and calls webhooks when alert statuses change.
- **JSON webhook** is a webhook example based on NodeJS, which accepts alert payload and saves it to the files for testing purposes.
- **Node-RED** provides an HTTP POST endpoint and sends a Slack notification with alert details.
