# Getting Started

The Business Intelligence platform utilizes Docker containers to be modular and scalable. This section describes one possible solution to demonstrate how you can get started.

It is a comprehensive solution that combines the Business Intelligence with other tools that we added to emulate a close-to-real-world scenario.

Feel free to follow the steps to arrive at the same results in your environment. From there, you can adjust as needed. 

:::tip Grafana 11

The Business Engine requires Grafana 11. The Business Intelligence platform will always be compatible with the most current Grafana version.

## Getting started solution overview

Once all parts of the suggested solution are installed and configured, end-users will work with the Business Studio to manage business engines, alert rules and actions, and other configurations. They also will have a Grafana instance where we preconfigured three dashboards:
 - one dashboard to display the business engine performance data,
 - two dashboards to display production data.

## Docker containers

All necessary docker containers can be downloaded from [GitHub repository](https://github.com/volkovlabs/business-intelligence).

<Image
  title="Download the configuration for the described solution."
  src="/img/big/github-where-download.png"
/> 

In the downloaded package, you can find `docker-compose.yml` file with the following containers:

- **Grafana** includes provisioned dashboards and data sources.
- **Timescale** database stores Business Engine configuration data and production data.
- **Data Emulator** is a NodeJS script that emulates production data. Also, it is needed to demonstrate variable functionality.
- **Prometheus** collects and stores performance metrics from the Business Engine.
- **JSON server** is an action example based on NodeJS. It accepts alert payload and saves it to the files when the Business Engine executes actions.
- **Business Engine** has a service account key to access Grafana HTTP APIs to extract necessary configurations. It evaluates alert rules and calls actions.

Below is `docker-compose.yml` file just for FYI. You do not need to copy it. It is a part of the package you download from the GitHub repository.

  language="yaml"
/>

## Start the platform

Once you download the solution package, navigate to its folder and execute the following commands.

### Grafana

1. Start Grafana container.

```
docker compose --profile grafana up -d
```

<Image

  src="/img/big/grafana-container-installed.png"
/> 

2. Open the URL 

```
http://localhost:3000 
```
and login as 'admin' with 'admin' password.

3. Create a service account with the 'Admin' role.

/> 

4. Create a token.

5. Update `GRAFANA_TOKEN` in the `docker-compose.yml` file

/> 

### Business Engine, Timescale, Prometheus

6. Start the Business Engine, Timescale database, and Prometheus containers. You can start all three using only one command since all three containers have the same profile, 'engine'.

```
docker compose --profile engine up -d
```

### JSON Server (optional)

7. We recommend starting a JSON Server to have an opportunity to experiment with it as well, but it is optional. Further, we will review how to configure JSON server calls after alert rule breaches. This call will write into the text log files. 

```
docker compose --profile actions up -d
```

### Business Studio

5. Download and start the Business Studio from [Release Notes](../release)

6. Configure Actions and Alert Rules

- Use JSON server `http://json-server:3000` for HTTP Request Action to create event and message files when alert triggered if started.
- Use provisioned `Test Dashboard` for adding Alert Rules based on thresholds and Regex pattern.

### Prometheus

Check performance and Prometheus metrics using provisioned `Business Engine` dashboard

## Stop the platform

Stop and delete all Docker containers

```
docker compose --profile engine down
docker compose --profile actions down
docker compose --profile grafana down
```
