# Getting Started

The Business Intelligence platform utilize Docker containers to be modular and scalable. The getting started configuration can be downloaded from [GitHub repository](https://github.com/volkovlabs/business-intelligence).

## Requirements

- Business Intelligence 2.X supports **Grafana 11**.

## Docker containers

The `docker-compose.yml` file consists of the following containers and can be used to start the platform:

- **Grafana** includes the provisioned dashboards and datasources.
- **Timescale** is required to store Business Engine configuration.
- **Business Engine** has a service account key to access Grafana HTTP APIs. It evaluates alert rules and calls actions when alert statuses change.
- **Prometheus** collects and store performance metrics from Business Engine.
- **JSON server** is an action example based on NodeJS, which accepts alert payload and saves it to the files for testing purposes.

  language="yaml"
/>

## Environment file

The Business Engine requires minimal configuration to start up:

- Timescale database credentials.
- Grafana URL and Token (Service Account).

<Code
  url="https://github.com/VolkovLabs/business-intelligence/blob/main/.env"
  language="shell"
/>

## Start the platform

1. Start Grafana container

```
docker compose --profile grafana up -d
```

2. Create Service Account and update `GRAFANA_TOKEN` in the `.env` file

3. Start the Business Engine, Timescale database, and Prometheus containers

```
docker compose --profile engine up -d
```

4. Start JSON Server to test Actions (optional)

```
docker compose --profile actions up -d
```

5. Download and start the Business Studio from [Releases](https://github.com/VolkovLabs/business-intelligence/releases)

6. Configure Actions and Alert Rules

- Use JSON server `http://json-server:3000` for HTTP Request Action to create event and message files when alert triggered if started.
- Use provisioned `Test Dashboard` for adding Alert Rules based on thresholds and Regex pattern.

8. Stop the Business Intelligence platform

```
docker compose --profile engine down
docker compose --profile actions down
docker compose --profile grafana down
```

## Support

You can create a Zendesk ticket to request assistance directly from the Business Studio:
