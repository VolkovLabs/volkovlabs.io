# Data Sources

This section provides examples of some supported data sources. Please note that the Business Intelligence platform supports most backend data sources available in Grafana. On this page, we started to collect examples of the most popular ones.

For now, there are two; we will add more soon. If your data source of interest is not here yet, feel free to contact us with questions.

| Data Source Example                     |
| --------------------------------------- |
| [PostgreSQL](../datasources/postgresql) |
| [Prometheus](../datasources/prometheus) |
