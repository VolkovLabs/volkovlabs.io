# Thresholds

To support higher high and lower low ranges, we pointed the Business Alerting to the **Thresholds** color for reading the allowable range of data. The Business Engine uses the **Thresholds** colors as a guide in the creation of alert records and calls the assigned webhook.

:::note Allowable range
The allowable range of data is a way to set what is normal, not requiring anyone's attention. No alerts/actions are needed when the data is within the allowable range.
:::

In the illustration below, three alert records have been created due to the data being outside the allowable range four times.

The alert rule configuration in the Business Studio looks as follows.

All devices, except the Tampa South 124, have all ranges of metrics allowed. The Tampa South 124 device generates an annotation when a metric value is above 30.

## Annotations

The alert records (annotations) are displayed as light blue highlighted areas on the graph.

The detailed annotation window pops up if you hover a mouse over a thick blue line (as illustrated above).

They highlight all time ranges when the data values (here, it is temperature) went outside the allowable range. In this example, the allowable range is from 0 to 30 (set in the **Thresholds** category).

Please note that no values (no registered temperature data) exist between the highest peak and the lowest deep on the graph. The temperature changes abruptly from max to min.

- The temperature for all four alerts goes above 30,
- For the second alert, it goes up to 90.5 degrees (illustrated with a tooltip).
