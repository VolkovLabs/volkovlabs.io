# Alert rules

Use the **Alert rules** tab to manage alert rules. Here you can:

1. Add a new alert rule.
2. Review the alert rule running states for each existing alert rule.
3. Review the alert rule alerting state for each existing alert rule.
4. Pause/Start the alert rule.
5. Delete the alert rule.

## Alert rules states

To temporate pause alert execution click on **Pause** icon for the specific alert rule. Alert can be started anytime to resume execution.

## Alert rules statuses

Right after an alert is created it becomes **Active** and **Scheduled**. After modification, the alert status changes to **Scheduled** if it requires reexecution with a new set of parameters.

- **Scheduled**. The alert is scheduled, but never run yet with a current set of parameters. This status is assigned right after the alert is created or modified by the user and API.
- **OK**. The alert has been run and the thresholds are NOT breached and the Regex pattern is NOT found.
- **Alerting**. The alert has been run and the thresholds are being breached or the Regex pattern is found.
- **Error**. Something is wrong which could be the query, annotation or action.

### Flow schema

Reference the flow schema to get a better understanding of how statuses change in the Business Engine.

## Add a new rule

The **Add a new rule** window looks as follows:

/>

The new alert rule/edit window has the following configuration elements to specify:

- **Details**
  - **Title** is an alert name.
  - **Schedule** is a frequency of how often the rule should run. Here you can select from the ready-to-use templates and adjust if needed. Alternatively, use a CRON expression to make your schedule as complex as needed.
- **Target**
  - **Dashboard** is a drop-down populated from the connected Grafana dashboard listing.
  - **Panel** is a drop-down populated from the selected dashboard.
    The alert rule will take queries and thresholds from there automatically.
- **Time Range**
  - **Source** could be either from the specified **Dashboard** or **Custom**.
- **Evaluation**. It could be set to:
  - **Thresholds**. The alert examines the data against thresholds set in the panel options.
  - **Regex Pattern**. The alert examines the specified fields (optional) and searches the specified pattern.
- **Event**
  - **Result sample size**. This parameter lets you specify how many rows in an alert result should be randomly picked up for saving and your analysis. The choice is between:
    - **All Values** and **Percentage**.
    - The **Results sample size** parameter is not applicable for the **Last value**.
- **Action**
  - **Actions**. Select from the drop-down list of the existing, pre-configured action APIs.
  - **Add Annotation**:
    - **Panel** to create and attach an annotation to a panel.
    - **Dashboard** to create and attach an annotation to a dashboard (i.e., all panels of this dashboard),
  - **Disabled** to disable the creation of any annotation following the alert rule breach.

### Schedule

Select from the templates and adjust if needed or specify a CRON expression to make your schedule as complex as needed.

## Multi-frames

The Business Engine supports multi-frame data sets. That means that the alert rule assigned to a dashboard and panel will be applied to all data frames fetched from the connected data source.

## Transformations

:::note BETA

Support of Grafana transformation is in beta state. This is due to the number of existing transformations.
:::

Grafana transformations are supported. However, please, note, that Grafana offers a large number of transformations, hence, there is a chance that some of them will not work correctly.
