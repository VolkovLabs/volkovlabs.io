# Alert rules

Use the **Alert rules** tab to manage alert rules. Here you can:

1. Add a new alert rule.
2. Review the alert rule running states for each existing alert rule. There are two possible states:

- **Active**,
- **Paused**.

3. Review the alert rule alerting state for each existing alert rule. There are five possible statuses:

- **Scheduled**,
- **OK**,
- **Alerting**,
- **Error**.

4. Pause/Start the alert rule.
5. Delete the alert rule.

:::note Future releases

In the future, the **Alert Rule** tab will provide an interface to work with hundreds of alert rules by allowing grouping, filtering, etc., to ensure easy navigation and control.

## Add a new rule

The **Add a new rule** window looks as follows:

/>

The new alert rule/edit window has the following configuration elements to specify:

- **Title** is an alert name.
- **Schedule** is a frequency of how often the rule should run. With CRON expressions your schedule can be as complex as needed.
- **Target Dashboard** and **Target Panel** are drop-downs to select from the existing ones. The alert rule will take queries and thresholds from there automatically.
- **Time Range** could be either taken from the dashboard or specified custom.
- The alert **evaluation** could be set to **Thresholds** or **Regex Pattern**.
  - For the **Thresholds**, the alert examines the data against thresholds set in the panel options.
  - For the **Regex Pattern**, the alert examines the specified fields (optional) and searches the specified pattern.
- For the alert **action**, select from the drop-down list of the existing, pre-configured action APIs.
- **Add Annotation** option.
  - specify **Panel** to create and attach an annotation to a panel,
  - specify **Dashboard** to create and attach an annotation to a dashboard (i.e. all panels of this dashboard),
  - specify **Disabled** to disable the creation of any annotation following the alert rule breach.
