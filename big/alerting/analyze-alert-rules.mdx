## Review Grafana data frames in the Business Studio

To make the interaction between the Business Engine and Grafana more transparent, the Business Studio displays the Grafana data frames participating in the alert rule evaluation.

To review the Grafana data frame in the Business Studio:

1.  Open the alert rule of interest.
2.  Optionally, on the **Alert settings** page confirm the alert rule is assigned to the dashboard(2.1) and panel(2.2) of interest.
3.  Open the **Data preview** page.
4.  Optionally, verify the dashboard variable (data frame filter) is set up to the necessary value.
5.  Review the Grafana data frame in the Business Studio.
6.  Optionally, review the same data frame in Grafana. Open the panel in the Edit mode and switch to the **Table view**.

- Verify the dashboard variable (data frame filter) is set up to the necessary value.
- Review the data frame in Grafana.
