# Actions

Use the [**Actions**](/big/studio/manage-business-engines/#5-tabs-os-the-business-engine-configuration) tab to manage actions. Here you can:

1. Add a new action.
2. Delete an existing action.
3. There must be at least one action configured. That is the reason why there has to be a **default** action without a trash can icon (not possible to delete).

The **Add a new action** window looks as follows:

/>

The new action/edit mode has the following configuration elements to specify:

- **Title** is an action name,
- **Type** (HTTP or Logs),
- **HTTP Request URL** and request **method**. You can add **Headers** (additional information) to a request if needed,
- **Message** template customizable using Handlebars.

You can use the **Test Connectivity** button to check REST API endpoint availability.
