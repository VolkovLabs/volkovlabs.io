/>

The new action/edit mode has the following configuration elements to specify:

- **Title** is an action name,
- **Type** (HTTP or Logs),
- **HTTP Request URL** and request **method**. You can add **Headers** (additional information) to a request if needed,
- **Message** template customizable using Handlebars.

You can use the **Test Connectivity** button to check REST API endpoint availability.

## Message template

Based on the JSON event payload you can create a customized message using Handlebars.

```Handlebars
{{event.alert.title}} ({{event.alert.state}})
```

### JSON helper

Presents an object (JSON) or an array as a formatted string.

```Handlebars
{{json event}}
```
