## Grafana Transformation Compatibility

Business Intelligence aligns with Grafana transformations, ensuring broad compatibility. Most core Grafana transformations—built on a general framework—work seamlessly. However, some niche transformations, tailored to specific data sources or scenarios, may deviate from this standard and could encounter issues.
