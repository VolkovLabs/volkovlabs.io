# Business Studio

Business Studio is the central control hub for the Business Intelligence platform. It provides an intuitive interface that consolidates all essential configurations into a single, user-friendly application.

With Business Studio, authorized users can connect to multiple Business Engines—each associated with a Grafana instance—and efficiently create and manage alert rules, reports and actions.
