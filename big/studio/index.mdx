# Business Studio

The Business Studio plays the role of the control center for the Business Intelligence platform, providing a user-friendly interface and keeping all necessary configurations in one place.

You start by connecting to as many Business Engines as needed, where each one is connected to a Grafana instance. From there, an authorized user can create and manage alert rules and actions.
