# Clusters

A cluster in the Business Studio is a group of business engines with the same token connected to the same configuration database and Grafana instance.

Clusters are displayed in the left-hand side menu. Each cluster has two pages.

- **Load balancing**,
- **Settings**.

We strive to achieve a high performance in business intelligence. Our approach to cluster load balancing is one of the things that helps the cause. We work to ensure better alert balancing between connected Business engines.

The existing architecture allows for running specific queries on specific business engines and completely avoids unnecessary duplication.

The current architecture prevents query duplication by executing all queries on specific business engines, thereby avoiding unnecessary run of the same queries.

### Load balancing

Here, you can see the number of business engines in the cluster and the number of scheduled alerts. Then, down below, you have a list of business engines with Grafana dashboards they serve. Each dashboard is displayed with a list of created alerts.
