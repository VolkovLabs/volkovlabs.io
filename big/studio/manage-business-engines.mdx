# Business Engines

This section assumes you’re familiar with the concept of a Business Engine. If not, review the [platform architecture](/big/#architecture) and the [Business Engine](/big/engine/) documentation for context.

## Adding and Deleting Engines

Business Studio enables you to add multiple Business Engines as required, each preconnected to a Grafana instance.

### Adding a New Engine

To add a Business Engine:

1. Click the **+ Add** button on the main screen
2. Provide the following details:
   - **Engine Name**: A unique identifier within Business Studio
   - **Engine URL**: The URL for accessing the Business Engine API
   - **Production or Community Token**: Unique to each Business Engine cluster; request additional Production tokens via the **Support** menu in the bottom-left corner

After adding, click the engine’s name in the list to review its configuration settings.

## Business Engine Overview

The **Overview** page displays key statistics—version, status (OK/Error), alert rule count, and action count—along with Alert History and high-availability (HA) status.

/>

**High Availability Status:**

- **Disabled**: Single Business Engine in the cluster
- **Enabled**: Multiple Business Engines in the cluster

## Alert Rules

The **Alert Rules** page integrates with the [Business Alerting](/big/alerting/) feature, available across all Business Engines. For details, see the [Alert Rules](/big/alerting/manage-alert-rules/) section.

## Actions

The **Actions** page allows configuration of actions—steps triggered by specific events, most commonly alert rule violations, though other scenarios are supported. Learn more in the [Actions](/big/studio/actions/) section.

## Environment

The **Environment** page lists all environment variables. The **Grafana -> Version** detail enhances transparency for version compatibility.

### Grafana Connection

Connect a Business Engine to a Grafana instance directly in Business Studio:

1. Scroll to the **Grafana** section
2. Click **Edit**
3. Enter the Grafana instance URL
4. Provide the service account token

/>

This updates the `grafana_token` column in the `environments` table.

:::info High Availability
For multiple Business Engines linked to a single Grafana instance, updating one engine’s settings applies to all others automatically.

## Settings

The **Settings** page includes the initial configuration details plus an **Update Engine License** option. Business Engines start with a Community license by default.

When **Update Engine License** is enabled, the Business Engine’s license token syncs with Business Studio’s token. To apply a new token:

1. Paste it into the **Token** field
2. Click **Save**
