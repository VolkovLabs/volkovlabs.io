# Business Engines

In this part of the documentation, we assume that, conceptually, you know what a Business Engine is. If not, please refer to the [platform schema](/big/#architecture) and its description, following by the [Business Engine](/big/engine/) section.

## Add and delete Engines

This feature allows to add as many Business Engines as needed to be in your system. Each of them should already be connected to a Grafana Instance. In the future, you can manage that connection from the Business Studio as well.

### Add a new Engine

To add a new Business Engine, click the **+ Add** button on the main screen and then specify the following:

- Engine name
  - Should be a unique name within the Business Studio.
- Engine URL
  - A URL to access Business Engine API.
- Production or Community token
  - Unique for each Business Engine Cluster.
  - Use the **Support** menu at the bottom left to request a new or additional Production tokens.

Once the Business Engine is added, you can review the configuration settings by clicking on its name in the list.

## Business Engine

### Overview

The **Overview** tab, in addition to the basic engine statistics such as version, status (ok/error), a number of alert rules and actions, features the Alert History and high availability marker.

/>

High availability can be:

- **Disabled**. If a Business Engine is the only one in the cluster.
- **Enabled**. If there are multiple (more than one) Business Engines in the cluster.

### Alert rules

The **Alert rules** tab is a part of the [Business Alerting](/big/alerting/) feature available in all Business Engines.

To learn more about alert rules, please refer to this documentation's [**Alert rules**](/big/alerting/manage-alert-rules/) section.

### Actions

The **Actions** tab helps to configure actions, which are the set of steps that are triggered by an expected event. The most common scenario is when an action is triggered after an alert rule is broken, but it is just one of the possible scenarios.

To learn more about actions, please refer to this documentation's [**Actions**](/big/studio/manage-alert-actions/) section.

### Environment

All environment variables are displayed on the **Environment** tab.

/>

The Business Studio allows you to establish that connection in the comfort of a user-friendly interface.

To accomplish that, follow the steps:

1. Scroll to the **Grafana** section.
2. Click the **Edit** button.
3. Provide Grafana instance URL.
4. Provide Service account token.

/>

With this user action, the `grafana_token` column of the `environments` table is updated. That means if multiple business engines are connected to the same Grafana instance (HA scenario), then with updating the settings only for one business engine, all others are automatically updated since they all point to the same database field.

:::info High Availability

If multiple Business Engines are connected to the same Grafana instance, then updating ONLY one Business Engine is required. The rest of the connected business engines will be updated automatically.

:::

### Settings

The **Settings** tab contains all the information you provided while creating the Business Engine plus one extra parameter - **Update Engine license**.

Initially Business Engine starts with the Community license.

When the **Update Engine license** parameter is checked, the Business Engine license token updates simultaneously with the Business Studio license token. This happens after you copy and paste a new token in the **Token** parameter and click the **Save** button.
