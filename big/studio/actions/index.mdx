# Actions

Use the Actions page to manage actions for the selected Business Engine. Here you can:

1. Add a new action.
2. Delete an existing action.
3. There must be at least one action configured.

## Add a new action

The **Add a new action** window looks as follows:

/>

The new action/edit mode has the following configuration elements to specify:

- **Title** is an action name
- **Type** options
  - **HTTP Request** will call URL and send JSON payload with event and applied message template.
  - If **Logs** selected, JSON payload will be printed in the Docker container output.
- **HTTP Request URL** and request **method**
  - Add **Headers** (additional information) to a request if needed.
- **Message**. To work on the messages generated by an alert rule more efficiently, we employed the [Monaco code editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/). It supports:
  - Handlebars syntax,
  - prompts (suggestions),
  - code formatting.

On the **Preview** page, you can immediately preview what the message will look like. A context menu with prompts appears after you place a dot after the `event` object.

## Use by default

Any action could be configured as a default one for new Alert Rules by setting the **Use by Default** parameter to **Enabled**.

## Test Connectivity

You can use the **Test Connectivity** button to check REST API endpoint availability.

## Message template

Based on the event's JSON payload you can create a customized message using Handlebars.

```Handlebars
{{ event.alert.title }} [{{ event.alert.state }}]
{{#if event.condition.repeatValue}}
Value: {{event.condition.repeatValue}}
{{/if}}
```

### JSON helper

Presents an object (JSON) or an array as a formatted string. Useful to see the structure of the event.

```Handlebars
{{{json event}}}
```
