# Exploring Annotations

Annotations in Grafana bring your dashboards to life by highlighting key events. They encompass three core elements:

- Native annotations
- Alerts
- Annotation queries

Curious about how they stack up? The schema below breaks it down.

:::info Key Distinction
Native annotations and Alerts are stored as records in Grafana’s configuration database, while Annotation queries are custom requests to fetch and display them on your dashboard.

## Understanding Annotation Queries

Annotation queries come in two flavors:

- **Built-in**: Basic functionality out of the box.
- **User-defined**: Flexible queries that can tap into any database—or even Grafana’s own storage with the [Business Satellite](/plugins/business-satellite/) data source.

Check out the dataflow schema below for a closer look.

Despite their names, native annotations and Alerts share a lot under the hood. With the [Business Satellite data source](/plugins/business-satellite), you can manage both seamlessly.

## Power Up with Business Satellite

We built the [Business Satellite data source](/plugins/business-satellite) to tackle a real-world production challenge. It lets you pull native annotations and Alerts from local or remote Grafana instances, with flexible filtering options. See it in action in the tutorial above.
