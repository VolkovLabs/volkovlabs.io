# Annotations

Annotations is an umbrella term that includes many Grafana artifacts.

The name of native annotations might imply they are a different kind of animal than Alerts. However, under the hood, they are very similar.

With a bit of help from the [Grafana HTTP API Data Source](/plugins/volkovlabs-grapi-datasource), you can easily work with both simultaneously.

## Grafana HTTP API Data Source

[Grafana HTTP API Data Source](/plugins/volkovlabs-grapi-datasource) supports retrieving annotations to display filtered native annotations and alerts from local and remote Grafana instances.
