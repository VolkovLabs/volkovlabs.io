# Unsigned Plugins

To allow unsigned plugins, enter a comma-separated list of plugin identifiers to load even if they are unsigned.

## Docker

Update environment variable in the Docker container.

```docker
GF_PLUGINS_ALLOW_LOADING_UNSIGNED_PLUGINS=PLUGIN-ID
```

## Host installation

Update `grafana.ini` for Host installation.

```sh
allow_loading_unsigned_plugins=PLUGIN-ID
```

## Manifest file

Signed plugins store checksum for all included files in the `MANIFEST.txt` file. Delete the `MANIFEST.txt` file if

- Need to modify `plugin.json` or any other plugin files.
- The plugin was signed for a specific URL and it does not match your Grafana's URL.

## Plugin Management

If you are not familiar with Plugin Management in Grafana, take a look at the [Plugin management](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/plugin-management/) in the documentation.
