# Unsigned Plugins Made Simple

To allow unsigned plugins in Grafana, just add a comma-separated list of plugin identifiers to load them without signatures. Here’s how to configure it for Docker or a host installation.

## Docker Configuration

Update the environment variable in your Docker container like this:

```sh
GF_PLUGINS_ALLOW_LOADING_UNSIGNED_PLUGINS=PLUGIN-ID
```

Replace `PLUGIN-ID` with your plugin identifiers (e.g., `my-plugin, another-plugin`).

## Host Installation

For a host setup, edit the `grafana.ini` file with:

```sh
allow_loading_unsigned_plugins=PLUGIN-ID
```

Swap `PLUGIN-ID` with the identifiers of your unsigned plugins.

## Manifest File Tweaks

Signed plugins use a `MANIFEST.txt` file to store checksums. Delete it if you need to:

- Modify `plugin.json` or other plugin files.
- Use a plugin signed for a URL that doesn’t match your Grafana instance.

## Learn More About Plugins

Not sure about plugin management? Check out Grafana’s [Plugin Management documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/plugin-management/) for a detailed guide.
