# Installation

For me, the only confusing part with installation was - finding a resource to download the official package.

The video below shows where it is located and also demonstrates the installation process for Windows, Mac and in a Docker container.

We published it last May (May of 2022), but it is still on point.

Should this video be a part of the crash course? Use the comment section under the video to express your thoughts.

We always can add more details about installation into this section. What would you add?
