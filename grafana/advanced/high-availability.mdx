# High Availability

Logically, this architecture should have at least two separate Grafana UI.

A load balancer will redirect the traffic between multiple Grafana UI depending on the load or other parameters.

The [High Availability configuration](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/set-up-for-high-availability/):

- Allows connecting many Grafana UI to the same configuration storage. Therefore, to have a matching experience across all of Grafana UI.
- Requires maintaining only one configuration database instance, regardless of the Grafana UI number.

It would be best to have a whole team of tech pros to support the web application with high upstream/downstream traffic and unstoppable 24/7 user requests.

## From default Grafana setup to the real deal

For those who would want to take the next step to an actual application, what direction should it be, or in other words, what should be modified in the default Grafana installation package to convert it into the real deal?
