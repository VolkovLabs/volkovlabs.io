# Canvas panel

The canvas panel is far from being complete but mature enough for a production environment. The breathtaking presentation featuring the house's energy with metrics and animated wind turbines gave many of us the itch to drop everything and try to build something with it.

As proved many times, Grafana is a champion in the observability of K8s clusters, monitoring logs, and traces.

However, we at Volkov Labs find it delightful to explore other Grafana possibilities. Time after time, we uncovered it being effective in areas yet to be considered. This time our love for pizza and the news about the Canvas panel being released as part of the core begged us to challenge ourselves with the pizzeria observability dashboard.
