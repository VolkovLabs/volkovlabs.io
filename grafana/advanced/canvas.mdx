# Unleashing Creativity with the Canvas Panel

Grafana’s a rockstar for Kubernetes observability, log monitoring, and tracing, no doubt. But at Volkov Labs, we love pushing its boundaries. Time and again, we’ve found it shines in unexpected places.

This time, our pizza obsession collided with the Canvas panel’s core release, inspiring us to whip up a pizzeria observability dashboard. Curious how it turned out? Check it out!
