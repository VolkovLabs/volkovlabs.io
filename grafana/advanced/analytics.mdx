# Website analytics

In this weekend's project, we found a way to collect and visualize the content metrics for our website. Who, What, and from Where requested our resources, like our blog and documentation.

To achieve this goal, we assembled Nginx, Loki, and Promtail into a pipeline to work together, showing all required metrics on a Grafana dashboard.
