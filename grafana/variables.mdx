## Dashboard Variables

Dashboard variables live within a single dashboard, powering filters and dynamic controls. They’re your go-to for tailoring what users see.

## Global Variables

Global variables tap into Grafana-wide settings, ready to use across your dashboards. Here’s a quick look at some handy ones:

| Variable          | Description                        |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `${__dashboard}`  | Name of the current dashboard      |
| `${__from}`       | Start of the time range (epoch ms) |
| `${__interval}`   | Time grouping parameter            |
| `${__org.name}`   | Name of the current organization   |
| `${__org}`        | ID of the current organization     |
| `${__to}`         | End of the time range (epoch ms)   |
| `${__user.email}` | Email of the current user          |
| `${__user.id}`    | ID of the current user             |
| `${__user.login}` | Login handle of the current user   |

## Environment Variables

Environment variables pull from the system where Grafana runs—think operating system or device settings. Normally out of reach, they’re unlocked with the Environment data source. Learn how in this post.
