# Build a Panel plugin

We are not here to lecture you on the basics of programming. If you are already looking to build a plugin for Grafana, you most likely know a thing or two about software development.

We thought that the "follow-me, step-by-step tutorial" format, where Daria demonstrates the steps, might be the fastest to get you up to speed.

To this day, we have created two parts of the tutorial. If you like our format, please indicate that by liking the videos on YouTube and leaving a comment.

We need to know if our effort helps and third part would bring value.

## Part 1

Follow along and have your first-panel plugin built and provisioned.

In this part, Daria walks you through the following 10 steps:

- Step 1. Prerequisites
- Step 2. Scaffolding
- Step 3. VS Code
- Step 4. Install dependencies
- Step 5. Build a plugin
- Step 6. Start Grafana instance
- Step 7. Login into Grafana UI
- Step 8. Create a dashboard
- Step 9. Provisioning
- Step 10. Rebuild the Grafana container

## Part 3 (final)

Part 3 is coming if the Community approves the format of Part 1 and Part 2 by liking and commenting on the videos, especially the second part. For some reason, Part 2 did not get much love yet.

We plan to cover the following:

- Step 21. Unit tests
- Step 22. End-to-end tests
- Step 23. Signing a plugin to make it a part of the Grafana catalog
- Step 24. Release Workflow
- Step 25. Variables
- Step 26. Bonus, adding a custom editor for panel options
