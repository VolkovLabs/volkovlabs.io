### Highlights from Part 3

#### Unit Tests

We rely on unit tests in our projects, targeting at least 90% coverage. Grafana’s plugin tools include two built-in test scripts: `test` and `test:ci`. The diagrams below illustrate their differences.

    </td>

      />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### End-to-End (E2E) Tests

E2E tests simulate human interaction with your application. While they can be challenging and prone to false positives, we find them valuable and recommend incorporating them into your plugin development workflow.
