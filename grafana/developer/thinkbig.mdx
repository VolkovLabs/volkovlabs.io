# Think Big

## You do not want to miss this insight

Initially, visualization panels have been designed to be a one-way data flow mechanism with the primary function of displaying graphs (lines, bars, pies, etcetera). 

In ancient times, users had a limited number of available visualizations. Their steps were:
- select a visualization from a drop-down list available in the edit mode of any panel
- guess the data format required by the selected panel
- connect to a data source ensuring that it fetches the data in the required format. 

Two community plugins expanded that paradigm beyond imaginable. 

Instead of limited number of visualizations, now you have infinite.
Instead of just visualization, now you can manage.

And here I feel I need to dive a little deeper into those plugins' functionality for the simple reason of showing you the potential you are up against. I want you to be able to color outside the lines and sculpt Grafana into the necessary form as opposed to trying to fit your requirements into the preset mold.

## Apache ECharts plugin

:::info Any chart

Apache ECharts plugin superpower:

Any visualization is possible, with no limitations. 

:::

``Apache EChart`` is an Open Source JavaScript Visualization library. 
As the name implies, it is one of many Apache Software Foundation projects. 

The library is, basically, a collection of highly customizable graphs. You customize graphs by specifying parameter values in JSON format. 

``Apache ECharts plugin`` brings all ``Apache EChart library`` power into Grafana dashboards. 

So, in Grafana terms, ``Apache ECharts plugin`` is a visualization panel. In my terms, it exponentially expanded the availalbe graph options for a user to choose from. 

Any, and I mean it, any graphical representation is available in ``Apache ECharts library``. If you find something not represented there yet, please, contact us. I am honestly curious what it might be.

## Data Manipulation panel

:::info Observability + Action = Mission Control Center

Data Manipulation panel superpower:

It can send data from Grafana into a data source!
As in one-two-three, you can combine observation with control of your data and the system's behavior.

:::

The data Manipulation plugin has vastly broadened the original scope of visualization panels.

If with the original design, a user was seen as a silent, opinionless reader then now with a Data Manipulation panel, a user is promoted to Mission Control Center commander.

## To Summarize 

We love how flexible the Grafana architecture is. If something was not originally thought of, you, the creator, are able to elegantly fill the gap. 

Grafana does not hold you back. Instead, it equips you with everything to work wonders.
It is the real beauty of Grafana!
