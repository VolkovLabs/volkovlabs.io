# Grafana Events (EventBus)

Grafana uses an event bus to publish application events to notify different parts of Grafana when the user acts.

```js
const subscription = eventBus.subscribe({ type: "data-hover" }, () => {
  console.log("Data hovered.");
});

return () => {
  subscription.unsubscribe();
};
```
