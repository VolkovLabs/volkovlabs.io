```bash
grafana cli --pluginUrl https://github.com/VolkovLabs/volkovlabs-env-datasource/releases/download/v4.0.0/volkovlabs-env-datasource-4.0.0.zip plugins install volkovlabs-env-datasource
```

### Unsigned version

Can be used with any Grafana instance. Requires to add the environment data source to the allowed unsigned plugin configuration.

```bash
grafana cli --pluginUrl https://github.com/VolkovLabs/volkovlabs-env-datasource/releases/download/v4.0.0/volkovlabs-env-datasource-4.0.0.unsigned.zip plugins install volkovlabs-env-datasource
```
