# Grafana Crash Course

Welcome to the Grafana Crash Course—a living, breathing guide from Volkov Labs. We’re constantly refining it, keeping pace with new Grafana releases, and embracing the truth that no course for a tool this dynamic can ever be “done”. It’s not static; it’s a resource that evolves alongside Grafana itself.

Collaboration drives us forward. Got a question, an idea, or even a rough article draft? We’d love your input—every contribution fuels this journey!

What started as [Daria’s personal notes](/blog/authors/daria/)—jotted down while exploring Grafana—grew into this. It wasn’t planned as a formal course, but rather emerged from curiosity, hands-on tinkering, and lively exchanges with the Grafana community.

## Who’s This For?

:::info Daria’s Take
Nobody wants to ‘learn’ Grafana. The problem-solving gang is hunting for answers to their specific questions.
:::

That casual quip became our north star. We skip the textbook slog—too slow for pros who need results now. This is for working developers and analysts like us: folks with tech know-how, facing daily challenges, and seeking fast, practical fixes. Imagine it as the rundown you’d give a seasoned dev on day one—sharp, focused, and ready to use.

## How It’s Organized

We didn’t script this course from start to finish. Instead, we took our pile of notes, videos, and posts, and sorted them into three buckets:

- [Getting Started](started): Your entry point to Grafana.
- [Advanced](advanced): Deeper insights for experienced users.
- [Developer](developer): Code-centric tips and tools.

No rigid syllabus here—just a toolkit to grab what you need, when you need it.

## Why We Built This

The Grafana community is thriving, and we’re excited to welcome new faces to this powerful platform. Once a playground for tech gurus, Grafana now pulls in pros from all angles—business intelligence, sensor data, IoT, and beyond.

With 10 million users worldwide, roughly 25% tap Grafana for our sweet spots: business insights, sensor monitoring, and IoT control. This course is our way of bridging that gap, delivering hands-on wisdom for today’s diverse Grafana crew.
