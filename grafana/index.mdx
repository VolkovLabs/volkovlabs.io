The Grafana community is constantly growing, and we are happy to welcome new professionals onboard this flexible and powerful tool.

In the recent past, Grafana has been of interest to primarily deep technology experts. Lately, more and more people from different backgrounds and skill sets are turning heads toward it.

25% of the 10 million Grafana user base uses it for [business intelligence](business/), sensor data, and the [Internet of Things (IoT)](iot) process control, which is our focus areas.

## Installation

This video is for anyone who just started with Grafana and wondering what the installation process looks like. The most efficient and cleanest option is to use Grafana in a docker container.
