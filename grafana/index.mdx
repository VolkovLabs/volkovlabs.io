# Grafana Crash Course

Welcome to the **Grafana Crash Course**—a dynamic, ever-evolving guide from Volkov Labs. We update it regularly to match Grafana’s latest releases, embracing the reality that a tool this powerful never has a “final” tutorial. This isn’t a static manual; it’s a living resource that grows with Grafana and its community.

Collaboration drives us forward. Got a question, an idea, or even a rough article draft? We’d love your input—every contribution fuels this journey!

What began as [Daria’s personal notes](/blog/authors/daria/)—scribbled while diving into Grafana—has transformed into this course. It’s not a polished textbook but a product of curiosity, hands-on experimentation, and vibrant discussions with the Grafana community.

## Who’s This For?

:::info Daria’s Take
Nobody wants to ‘learn’ Grafana. The problem-solving gang is hunting for answers to their specific questions.
:::

This insight guides us. Forget lengthy textbooks—too slow for pros who need results fast. This course is for working developers, analysts, and tech-savvy folks like us: people with real-world challenges who want practical, actionable solutions. Think of it as the quick briefing you’d give a seasoned dev on their first day—sharp, focused, and ready to apply.

## How It’s Organized

We didn’t design this course as a linear journey. Instead, we’ve distilled our notes, videos, and posts into three core areas:

- **[Getting Started](started)**: Your launchpad into Grafana basics.
- **[Advanced](advanced)**: Deeper dives for seasoned users.
- **[Developer](developer)**: Code-focused tips and tools for builders.

No strict syllabus—just a flexible toolkit. Pick what you need, when you need it.

## Why We Built This

Grafana’s community is booming, and we’re thrilled to welcome newcomers to this versatile platform. Once a niche tool for tech experts, Grafana now attracts diverse users—from business intelligence analysts to IoT innovators and sensor data specialists.

With over 10 million users globally, about 25% use Grafana for our key focus areas: business insights, sensor monitoring, and IoT control. This course bridges the gap, offering practical, hands-on guidance for today’s varied Grafana audience.
