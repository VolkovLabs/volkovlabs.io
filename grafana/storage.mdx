# PostgreSQL with Timescale

People often ask, what is our database of choice to work with Grafana? We say PostgreSQL with the Timescale extension.

Timescale is an open-source time-series SQL database optimized for fast ingest and complex queries. Packaged as a PostgreSQL extension.

- Time-series,
- Relational.

Those are the three primary storage needs for our commercial applications. PostgreSQL was an easy and obvious choice.
