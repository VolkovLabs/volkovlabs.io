## Why PostgreSQL with Timescale Shines

PostgreSQL isn’t just a database—it’s the ultimate storage partner for Grafana, ticking all the key boxes:

- Time-series: Handle time-stamped data like a pro.
- Relational: Connect the dots across your data.

For our commercial apps, these three needs—configuration, time-series, and relational—are non-negotiable. PostgreSQL with Timescale made the choice a no-brainer. Dive deeper in this post.
