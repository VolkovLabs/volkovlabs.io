# Security Guidelines

This guide answers common security questions about the Business Suite and provides best practices for safe usage. Plugin-specific notes are included at the end.

## JavaScript-Enhanced Plugins

Our plugins leverage JavaScript to offer unmatched customization, a top-requested feature that supercharges Grafana’s capabilities. With great power comes great responsibility—here’s how to use it safely.

:::caution Know the Risks
JavaScript code can be edited in Edit mode by Admin and Editor users, potentially introducing vulnerabilities if not managed properly.
:::

Grafana runs JavaScript in a sandboxed environment, minimizing risks. To further secure your JavaScript-enriched plugins, we recommend:

- **Provisioning**: Lock dashboards to prevent unauthorized changes.
- **Access Restrictions**: Limit who can edit panels.

## Provisioning

Provisioning ensures end users can’t save dashboard modifications. Learn the ins and outs of this approach in our detailed video tutorial:

:::note
Provisioning is ideal for production environments where stability is key.
:::

## Access Restrictions

Restrict Admin and Editor roles to trusted users only. Viewers can’t access Edit mode, eliminating accidental or malicious changes.

## Plugin-Specific Recommendations

The following tips address security considerations for specific Business Suite plugins.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="text" label="Business Text" default>
    You can set the default setting `disable_sanitize_html = false` to keep security restrictions in place. However, with that many action tags will be disabled. For instance, your panels will not display HTML elements like buttons.

```sh
disable_sanitize_html = true
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="input" label="Business Input">
    The [Business Input data source](/plugins/business-input/) includes a
    JavaScript Value Editor, which can be disabled in the data source options
    for added safety:

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
