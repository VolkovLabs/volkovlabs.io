# Business Media

The Business Media panel is a Grafana plugin that renders PNG, JPG, GIF, MP4, WEBM, MP3, OGG, and PDF files encoded in the base64 format and URL.

The panel offers great flexibility, allowing users to display multiple media files and flip through them. You can mix and match any supported formats for multi-media file visualizations, allowing you to create the desired visual experience.

- If the data source returns more than one field of the `string` type, you can select the Field Name in the panel's display options.
- You can fit image dimensions to the panel size, keep the original values, or adjust dimensions based on the manually supplied values.
- Allows adding a URL with a title to navigate to other dashboards when clicking the image. URL supports dashboard variables.
