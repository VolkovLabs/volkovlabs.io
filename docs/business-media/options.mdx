## Toolbar

- **Auto play**.
- **Download**. Works for the **Image** type only. This enables a button that triggers the downloading of the selected image.
- **Navigation**. This enables a set of buttons to page media files back and forward.
- **Zoom**. Works for the **Image** type only. This option has two sub-options:
  - **Full Screen**. This enables one button that allows your image to be opened in full-screen mode.
  - **Pan and Pinch**. This enables three buttons to zoom in and out of your image.

## URL

:::info version
Starting from version 6.1.0, the **URL** category became redundant since Grafana added the **Data links** category, which is fully supported by the Business Media panel.
:::

In the **URL** category, you can specify two parameters:

- **Image URL**. This address will be opened after a user clicks on the image.
- **Title**. This text will pop up when a user hovers a mouse over the image.

## Video/Audio

In the **Video/Audio** category, there are specific to these formats parameters:

- **Controls**. **Enabled** instructs the panel to display the video and audio controls.
- **Auto Play**. When **Enabled**, the video and audio automatically start playing without sound.
- **Infinity Play**. With **Enabled**, the file plays in an endless loop.
- **Poster Image**. You can specify a poster image (thumbnail) file for your video files. A poster image is an image that is shown before the user clicks on the play button (unless the **Auto play** is enabled). The image can be in the base64 format or a link to the external web resource.

## Image

In the **Image** category there is one drop-down parameter **Scale Algorithm** to specify how scaling of the image should be done. We have three options to choose from:

- **Auto**. A browser chooses the best available algorithm.
- **Crisp Edges**. The image is scaled with an algorithm that preserves contrast and edges in the image. Generally intended for images such as pixel art or line drawings, no blurring or color smoothing occurs.
- **Pixelated**. The image is scaled with the "nearest neighbor" or similar algorithm, preserving a "pixelated" look as the image changes in size.

:::info
The **Crisp Edges** option is not supported in all browsers: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/image-rendering
:::

## PDF

Most browsers have a PDF toolbar by default. You can disable that default if needed.

## Width and Height

The **Width** and **Height** categories allow control of the image size on the dashboard.

<Image

  width="70%"
/>

- **Panel**. The width or height will fit the current panel size.
- **Original**. The width or height will be taken from the original file.
- **Custom**. Here you can either take the sizing from the connected data frame field or give a specific number in pixels.
- **Original with scroll**. You can allow scrolling only horizontally, vertically, or simultaneously in both directions.

## Data links

:::info version
The **Data links** feature is supported starting from the Business Media panel version 6.1.0
:::

Following Grafana 11 new features, we removed previously existing image links (the **URL** category) and allowed using a new **Data links** feature instead.

<Image

The links can open in the same tab or a new tab.
