# Recipes

This page includes helpful snippets for usage in your templates.

## Initial context

Displays the initial context within which the template is executed.

````handlebars
```json
{{{json @root}}}
```
````

Please take a look at the [documentation](https://handlebarsjs.com/api-reference/data-variables.html#root) for Handlebars variables.

## Iterate through all fields in each record

The **Render template** toggle should be set as `All rows` in the plugin options.

```handlebars
{{#each data}}
  {{#each this}} {{@key}}: {{this}} {{/each}}
{{/each}}
```

## Conditional content

This snippet shows how to display different content based on specific conditions.

```handlebars
{{#if (eq app "auth")}}
  This is the auth app.
{{else}}
  This is not an auth app.
{{/if}}
```

## Specific row in the data

To reference a specific row in the returned dataset, set the **Render template** toggle as `All rows`.

```handlebars
{{data.4.title}}
```

### Handlebars variables

This snippet shows how to iterate through an array of data and display the title of the third item of the array with the `@index` variable.

```handlebars
{{#each data}}
  {{#if (eq @index 3)}}
    {{title}}
  {{/if}}
{{/each}}
```
