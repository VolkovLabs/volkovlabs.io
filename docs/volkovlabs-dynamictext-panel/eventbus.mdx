# Grafana Events

:::info Version

Dynamic Text Panel supports the event bus since version 4.0.0.

:::

Grafana uses an event bus to publish application events to notify different parts of Grafana when the user interacts with it. Dynamic Text Panel can respond to these interactions by subscribing to one or more events.

## Predefined Events

A full list of events is available in our [Grafana Crash Course](/grafana/developer/eventbus).

## Subscribe to events

To avoid memory leaks, all events must be unsubscribed.

```
const subscription = eventBus.subscribe({ type: 'data-hover' }, () => {
  console.log('React to Data Hover')
})

return () => {
  subscription.unsubscribe();
  console.log('Unsubscribed');
}
```
