# External JS and CSS

:::info Version

The external resources are supported by the Dynamic Text panel starting from version 4.1.0.

:::

The dynamic text panel allows the loading of additional JavaScript and CSS Resources using external URLs like CDN (Content Delivery Network).

You can store CSS/JS files on your Grafana instance, in the public folder to prevent loading 3rd party URLs.

## Sanitizing

Sanitizing configuration should be disabled to see External Resources in the Panel Options.

## JavaScript Code

External CSS/JS files can be used to include additional visual elements, and JavaScript functions to execute from the [JavaScript Code](/plugins/volkovlabs-dynamictext-panel/code) editor.
