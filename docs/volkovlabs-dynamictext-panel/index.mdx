# Dynamic Text Panel

Dynamic Text Panel is a Grafana visualization plugin that you can use to convert plain text and table data into visually appealing, easy-to-read information cards. For that, the offered arsenal includes:

- Access to variables (dashboard and global),
- Markdown,
- Handlebars,
- Helpers (predefined and your own),
- CSS styles
- JavaScript.

By working with the Dynamic Text Panel plugin you construct a text visualization template:

- using the above-mentioned features and
- indicating the spots where the fetched data frame elements should be placed.

Below is the last of three videos we created to demonstrate the possibilities of this plugin.
Please, note, that since the date the last video was published (August 15, 2023), we introduced many more features.
