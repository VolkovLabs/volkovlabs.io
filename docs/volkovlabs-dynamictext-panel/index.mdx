The Business Text Panel is a Grafana visualization plugin that you can use to convert plain text and table data into visually appealing, easy-to-read information cards. For that, the offered arsenal includes:

- Access to variables (dashboard and global),
- Markdown,
- Handlebars,
- Helpers (predefined and your own),
- CSS styles
- JavaScript.

By working with the Business Text plugin you construct a text visualization template:

- using the above-mentioned features and
- indicating the spots where the fetched data frame elements should be placed.
