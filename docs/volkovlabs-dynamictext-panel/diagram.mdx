# Mermaid Diagram

:::info
Mermaid Diagrams are not included in the official plugin because of the mermaid+d3 library size increase.

You can download the [signed CI artifact](https://github.com/VolkovLabs/volkovlabs-dynamictext-panel/actions/runs/4520732135) with Mermaid to use.

:::

Mermaid is a popular JavaScript-based diagramming and charting tool that renders Markdown-inspired text definitions to create and modify diagrams dynamically and is a perfect companion for the Dynamic Text Panel.
