# Mermaid Diagram

:::info CI Artifact
Mermaid diagrams are not included in the official plugin bundle because of the considerable increase in plugin size caused by the integration of the `mermaid+d3` library.

You can download the [signed CI artifact](https://github.com/VolkovLabs/volkovlabs-dynamictext-panel/actions/runs/4520732135) with Mermaid to build diagrams.

:::

Mermaid is a popular JavaScript-based diagramming and charting tool that dynamically creates and modifies diagrams using Markdown-defined text definitions, making it an ideal companion for Dynamic Text Panel.

### Example

Markdown can include data from a data source and style it with a CSS editor.

```diagram
flowchart LR
  A[Hard] -->|Text| B(Round)
  B --> C{Decision}
  C -->|One| D[Result 1]
  C -->|Two| E[Result 2]
```
