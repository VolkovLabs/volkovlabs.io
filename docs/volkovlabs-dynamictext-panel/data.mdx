# Data

You can choose how the retrieved data is passed into the Dynamic Text Panel.

- `Every row` means that the **Content** template is applied to every retrieved row.
- `All rows`, the query results are passed entirely as the `data` field to the template.

To work with the query results as a whole, you can use [#each builtin helper](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/builtin-helpers.html#each) to iterate over the records.

## Every row

If your data source returns the following four columns of data.

```md
| app  | description                  | cluster | tier     |
| ---- | ---------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| auth | Handles user authentication. | prod    | frontend |
```

### Template

Display it using the following template for each row.

```md
# {{app}}

> {{description}}

{{#if (eq tier "frontend")}}
Link: <a href="https://{{cluster}}.example.com/{{app}}">https://{{cluster}}.example.com/{{app}}</a>
{{/if}}
```

## Render a single template (All rows)

For the following query result.

| title | author        | year |
| ----- | ------------- | ---- |
| Dune  | Frank Herbert | 1965 |
| 1984  | George Orwell | 1949 |

### Template

Given that All Rows is selected, the following template renders a table from the query result.

```
| Title | Author | Year |
| ----- | ------ | ---- |
{{#each data}}
| {{title}} | {{author}} | {{year}} |
{{/each}}
```
