# Data

You can choose how the retrieved data is passed into the Dynamic Text Panel.

- `Every row` means that the **content** template is applied to every retrieved row.
- `All rows`, the query results are passed entirely as the `data` field to the template.

In order to work with the query results as a whole, you can use [#each builtin helper](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/builtin-helpers.html#each) to iterate over the records.

## Render a single template (All rows)

For the following query result:

| title | author        | year |
| ----- | ------------- | ---- |
| Dune  | Frank Herbert | 1965 |
| 1984  | George Orwell | 1949 |

Given that the **All Rows** switch is turned on, the following template renders a table from the query result:

```
| Title | Author | Year |
| ----- | ------ | ---- |
{{#each data}}
| {{title}} | {{author}} | {{year}} |
{{/each}}
```
