## Tutorial

This is the first video we created about Business Charts after the plugin rebranding. It features dazzling chart examples followed by a high-level plugin architecture. Knowing the basics of plugin architecture will help you create your custom charts. 

To get you started quicker we prepared the [web resource](https://echarts.volkovlabs.io/) with numerous ready-to-use examples. In the video, I demonstrate how to work with this resource. 

The main obstacle for many plugin users is the data transmission from the Grafana data frame(s) into the [Charts function](/plugins/business-charts/options/). In the video, in addition to the resource with how-to examples, I introduce the Visual Editor - the mechanism we started to work on to simplify the transmission.
