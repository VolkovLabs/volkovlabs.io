The Business Charts panel allows you to integrate charts and graphs created by the [Apache ECharts library](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html) into your Grafana dashboard.

Apache ECharts is a powerful and versatile data visualization library providing a wide range of chart types including statistical capabilities. It is written in pure JavaScript and based on [zrender](http://ecomfe.github.io/zrender/), a lightweight graphic library for chart rendering.

The Business Charts plugin offers an easy way of adding intuitive, interactive, and highly customizable charts to your Grafana dashboard.
