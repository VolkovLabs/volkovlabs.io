## Delete Request

Configure the **Delete Request** in the **Delete Data** section.

First, select the data source where the delete commands should go to. Then, choose the **Query Editor** mode if it's supported in the data source. Your choice is:

- **Builder**. It uses the standard Grafana query builder.
- **Code**. It allows you to specify an update request query in a language appropriate for your data source.
