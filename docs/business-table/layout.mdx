# Layout

The **Layout** parameter category determines the set of tabs and then the set of columns and their display types for each tab.

## Column types to display data

A column display type is specified in the **Layout**->**Format**->**Type** and determines what the data looks like when displaying for a user review. At this moment, there are 8 available types to choose from.

### Nested objects

See the [Nested Ojects](/plugins/business-table/nested/) section of this documentation.

### Preformatted

The **Preformatted type**, which is similar to the `pre` HTML tag, is designed to display text with spaces and line breaks preserved. This means the text is shown exactly as it is written, without any formatting changes.

If the **Preformatted style** switch is On, the text is displayed in the fixed-width font.
If the **Preformatted style** switch is Off, the text is displayed in the font configured for the user's browser.

### Multi tables as tabs

The Business Table panel allows you to have a multi-tabs view and configure the fields of each tab separately.

To add a new tab, use the **New Table** parameter.
To add a column to an existing tab, use the **New Column** parameter.

### Tree View/Row grouping

This feature allows you to combine unique field values into groups and collapse/expand using little arrows to create a layout similar to Tree View.

<Image

  width="60%"
/>

Below is the steps of how to configure Business Table panel Tree View.

### Auto-width columns

The column width can be determined automatically within a specified range or explicitly hardcoded by a user in pixels.

<Image

  src="/img/plugins/business-table/auto-width.png"
/>

### Table footer

Every column of the Business Table panel has the **Show in Footer** property.
If at least one column has it set up, then a footer will be shown.

You can select the aggregation function individually for each column to be applied toward the value displayed in the footer.

### Filtering

The Business Table panel starts strong with the filtering feature offering two main options:

- Client,
- Query.

#### Client

Every column of the Business Table panel offers the **Filter** feature. If set to **Yes**, the funnel icon will appear next to the column header.

With the **Filter Mode**->**Client**, when a user clicks on the funnel icon further filterimg options appear. 

What those options are depends on the column data type:

 - **String**
    - **Search** (step 5 from the image below). It provides a form to type free text or enter a number value to use in the filtering.
    - **Options** (step 6 from the image below). It provides a multi-select list of all existing values in the column.

<Image
  title="The Client filtering feature of the Business Table panel for the String data type."
  src="/img/plugins/business-table/filtering-client-string.png"
/>

 - **Number**

  Select from a list of mathematical operations and specify a number to apply it towards.

<Image
  title="The Client filtering feature of the Business Table panel for the Number data type."
  src="/img/plugins/business-table/filtering-client-number.png"
/>

 - **Time**

 Select a time range using a standard Grafana range picker.

<Image
  title="The Client filtering feature of the Business Table panel for the Time data type."
  src="/img/plugins/business-table/filtering-client-time.png"
/>

#### Query

This method of filtering allows panel interconnectivity or use in the data links. With the **Filter Mode**->**Query**, the displayed data is filtered according to the selected dashboard variables.

Below is how you can configure the **Query** filtering method. 

<Image
  title="The Query filtering feature of the Business Table panel."
  src="/img/plugins/business-table/filtering-query.png"
/>

In this example, two panels are working together (panel interconnectivity). A user selects a value on the Business Variable panel, changing the status displayed in the Business Table panel.

<Image
  title="Panel interconnectivity, the selected value on the Business Variable panel impacts the Business Table panel data."
  src="/img/plugins/business-table/query-filtering-w-var.gif"
/>

### Sorting

Every column of the Business Table panel has the **Sort** property. Set it to **Yes** and then specify the default sorting order - ascending or descending. The sorting icon appears next to the column header. The order changes to the opposite after the user clicks on the icon.

<Image
  title="The Business Table panel supports the Sorting feature."
  src="/img/plugins/business-table/sorting.png"
/>

### Pin Columns

It is a helpful feature for the wide tables. You can pin any column to always stay visible on the left or right.

<Image

Below, the column **Country** is pinned to the left.

<Image
  title="The column Country is pinned to the left."
  src="/img/blog/2024-09-26-business-table-1.3.0/pin.gif"
  width="50%"
/>

### Show and hide columns

:::info version
The feature is supported starting from version 1.5.0
:::

This feature allows you to hide/show any column in your Business Table visualization. It is helpful when you need to experiment with the table's visual aspects without removing the column (and all its configuration) to get an idea of what the visualization would look like without it.

Also, the column might be required for the underlying logic but not designed for the end user.

<Image
  title="Hide and show columns in the Business Table panel."
  src="/img/blog/2024-10-04-business-table-1.5.0/hide-show.png"
  width="60%"
/>

### Option to hide the table header

:::info version

Option to hide the table header is supported starting from the Business table 1.9.0

:::

You can hide the Business Table header from the dashboard by turning off the **Layout**->**Show header** switch.

<Image
  title="Show or hide the table header."
  src="/img/blog/2024-12-04-business-table-1.9.0/show-hide.png"
  width="70%"
/>

:::tip

The plus icon (the button to add a row) is also hidden if you hide a table header. That means if you need a user to have the ability to add a row, keep the table header visible.
