# Business Table

The Business Table panel allows you to simplify data visualization in table format.

In addition to the all-around columns/rows visualization functionality, the Business Table effortlessly combines with all other plugins from the Business Suite. For instance, below is an example where the Business Variable and Business Table work together to facilitate user-intuitive filtering via dashboard variables.
