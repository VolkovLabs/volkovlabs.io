Data adding configuration itself and permissions for it are done in a the **Add Data** category. All columns you add in the **Layout** category, you can further configure there.

## Add a row configuration

Below are details on how you can configure the add a row feature.

Use **Add data** parameter category to specify:

1.  Which tabs of your Business Table panel should allow to add a row.
2.  What columns should a user specify while adding a new row. It is done by turning on the switch next to a column name.
3.  The [**Editor Type**](/plugins/business-table/editor-types) is a UI element to enter a new value.
4.  [Permission](/plugins/business-table/permission) is a granular control of who is allowed to add a new row.
5.  **Add Request** consists of a data source and the query.
6.  Ensure to set **Layout**->**Show header** to ON, so users have access to the add a row (icon plus) button.

## Add Request

Configure the **Add Request** (the request that takes user-entered values and transmits them into your data source, serving as a bridge between user input and data source) in the **Add Data** section.

First, select the data source where the updated values should go to. Then, choose the **Query Editor** mode if it's supported in the data source. Your choice is:

- **Builder**. It uses the standard Grafana query builder.
- **Code**. It allows you to specify an update request query in a language appropriate for your data source.
