# Editable data

- Every column has separate editable/permission settings.
- User can enter a new value manually or select from the predefined listing coming from your data source.
- The Update Request (the request that takes user-entered values and transmits them into your data source, serving as a bridge between user input and data source) is configurable and allows custom logic.
- The permission can be Grafana user-based (Viewer/Editor/Admin/None) or regulated from the backend.

Editing and permissions settings are done in a new **Editable Data** category. All columns you add into the **Layout** category, you can further configure there.

To make a column editable, turn the appropriate switch on. With that the tag **Editable** appears next to the column name in the **Layout** category.

## Editable column types

After you turn the editable switch ON, determine the type for the editable column. Depending on your choice, more parameters appear.

You can choose between the following types:

- **String**. It allows a user to enter a value manually.
- **Number**. It allows a user to enter a numerical value manually. Optionally, you can specify the **Min** and **Max** for the allowed values.
- **Select**. It gives users a drop-down populated from the **Value Field** parameter. Optionally, you can specify **Label Field**. Both parameters, **Value field** and **Label Field**, come from the dataframe:column of your data source.
- **Datetime**. It allows a user to enter a value in the datetime format. Optionally, you can specify a range of allowed datetimes using **Set Min Date** and **Set Max Date** parameters.

## Update Request

Configure the Update Request (the request that takes user-entered values and transmits them into your data source, serving as a bridge between user input and data source) in the **Editable Data** -> **Settings** section.

First, select the data source where the updated values should go to. Then, choose the **Query Editor** mode if it's supported in the data source. Your choice is:

- **Builder**. It uses the standard Grafana query builder.
- **Code**. It allows you to specify an update request query in a language appropriate for your data source.
