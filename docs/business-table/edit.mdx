# Edit data

Editing and permissions for data editing are done in a the **Edit Data** category. All columns you added into the **Layout** category, you can further configure there.

To allow the edit action on a column, turn the appropriate switch on. With that the tag **Editable** appears next to the column name in the **Layout** category.

## Update Request

Configure the **Update Request** (the request that takes user-entered values and transmits them into your data source, serving as a bridge between user input and data source) in the **Edit Data** -> **Settings** section.

First, select the data source where the updated values should go to. Then, choose the **Query Editor** mode if it's supported in the data source. Your choice is:

- **Builder**. It uses the standard Grafana query builder.
- **Code**. It allows you to specify an update request query in a language appropriate for your data source.
