# Data sources as variables

:::info version

The feature is supported starting from version 1.9.0
:::

All Business Table data flows are configurable separately, allowing unbeatable flexibility. Starting from this release, a data source in every flow can be specified as a variable.

Let's say a Grafana dashboard has the following dashboard variable:

- **Variable type**: Data source,
- **Name**: DS,
- **Type**: PostgreSQL.

You can use this variable in every data flow that affects:

- row,
- [nested objects](/plugins/business-table/nested/) stored as a column value.

### Row

Rows has three possible data flows:

- **Add data**. Executed:
  - if the add a row functionality is allowed,
  - after a user clicks on a (+) icon to add a new row.
- **Editable data**. Executed:
  - if the edit a row functionality is allowed,
  - after a user clicks on the pencil icon to edit a row.
- **Delete data**. Executed:
  - if the delete a row functionality is allowed,
  - after a user clicks on a trash can icon to delete a row.
