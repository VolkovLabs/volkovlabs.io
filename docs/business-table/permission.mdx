In the **Permission** parameter of **Add Data**, **Edit Data**, or **Delete Data** set the **Check** parameter to one of the following:

- **Always Allowed**. Every user has permission.
- **By Org User Role**. With that, you need to specify which roles have permission (**Editor**, **Viewer**, **Admin**, **None**).
- **By Backend**. With that, you need to specify a data frame column with a boolean value. If the value is **true**, a user has permission. If the value is **false**, a user does NOT have permission.
