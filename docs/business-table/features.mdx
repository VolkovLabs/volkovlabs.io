## Row grouping

This feature allows you to combine unique field values into groups and collapse/expanse using little arrows.

## Multi tables as tabs

The Business Table panel allows you to have a multi-tabs view and configure the fields of each view separately.

To add a new tab, use the **New Table** parameter.
To add a column to an existing tab, use the **New Column** parameter.

## Auto-width columns

The column width can be determined automatically within a specified range or explicitly hardcoded by a user in pixels.

## Table footer

Every column of the Business Table panel has the **Show in Footer** property.
If at least one column has it set up, then the Footer will be shown.

You can select the aggregation function separately for each column to be applied toward the value displayed in the Footer.

## Filtering

The Business Table panel starts strong with the filtering feature offering two main options:

- Client,
- Query.

### Client

Every column of the Business Table panel offers the **Filter** feature. If set to **Yes**, the funnel icon will appear next to the column header.

With the **Filter Mode**->**Client**, when a user clicks on the funnel icon, depends on the value type they see the two types for further filtering.

- **Search**. It provides a form to type free text or enter a number value to use in the filtering.
- **Options**. It provides a multi-select list of all existing values in the column.

/>

### Query

This method of filtering allows panel interconnectivity or use in the data links. With the **Filter Mode**->**Query**, the displayed data is filtered according to the selected dashboard variables.

/>

## Sorting

Every column of the Business Table panel has the **Sort** property. If set to **Yes**, the ascending sorting icon appears next to the column header. After the user clicks on the icon, the order changes to descending.

## Pagination

You have a choice of two pagination modes: **Client** and **Query**.

/>

### Client

With the **Client** mode, all records are retrieved by the Business Table panel simultaneously and then divided into the pages by your browser. By default, ten rows per page are displayed. A user can change it to 20, 50, 100 or 1000.

The **Client** mode is the easiest and fastest to set up. However, users might experience performance issues since all data must be retrieved before being separated into pages.

/>

### Query

With the **Query** mode, only records needed for the current display are retrieved. That approach guarantees better performance for the end-users.

The determination of what records to retrieve (what records need to be displayed) is done by using the following variables:

- **pageIndex**. Page order number. Specify as a dashboard variable name.
- **offset**. How many rows to skip starting from the first. Specify as a dashboard variable name.
- **pageSize**. The number of rows per page. Specify as a dashboard variable name.
- **Total Count Field**. Specify as a dataframe:column name. **Preffered** to set to display total number of pages.

The necessity of the first three metrics (**pageIndex**, **offset**, **pageSize**) is contingent on the data source from which the data is sourced. Understanding this dependency will prepare you for efficient data retrieval.

In the example below, we use the Timescale data source, consequently SQL, to retrieve the data. **pageIndex** and **offset** are enough metrics in that case.

## Pin Columns

It is a helpful feature for the wide tables. You can pin any column to always stay visible on the left or right.

  width="50%"

Below, the column **Country** is pinned to the left.

## Download button

You can add a download button right on the Business Table visualization for an intuitive user experience.

/>

## Data links

The Business Table visualization supports the **Data links** feature. In the example below, when a user clicks on a row, two links are suggested in the popup window.

You can use the Grafana **Overrides** feature to configure column links (not for the whole row).
