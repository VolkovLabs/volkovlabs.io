## Filtering

The Business Table panel starts strong with the filtering feature offering two main options:

- Client,
- Query.

### Client

Every column of the Business Table panel offers the **Filter** feature. If set to **Yes**, the funnel icon will appear next to the column header.

With the **Filter Mode**->**Client**, when a user clicks on the funnel icon, depends on the value type they see the two types for further filtering.

- **Search**. It provides a form to type free text or enter a number value to use in the filtering.
- **Options**. It provides a multi-select list of all existing values in the column.
