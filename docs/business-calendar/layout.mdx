:::info Version

Starting from version 3.8.0, the Business Calendar panel displays dots representing events for that day.

In the **Year** view, the Business Calendar panel displays dots representing events that day. If there are more than 3 events, the plus symbol is shown.

The multi-day events are displayed as one dot per day. For instance, if an event lasts from September 16 to September 17 (two day event), two dots are shown on the panel, one dot for September 16 and the other dot for September 17.

## Date and time format

As you know, there is a Language setting in the user profile preference. Along with language this setting also impacts the displayed date formats.

:::info Version

The extended date formats are supported starting from version 3.0.0.

:::

The currently existing choices were not enough for some of our use cases. We added **English 24** and **ISO 8601** formats.

If the **Date and time format** is set to **User selection**, the language preferece is taken from the User profile-> Prefereneces->Language.

All other options override the user profile settings.

The panel specific language(datetime) format is supported starting from version 3.8.0

:::

The **Date and time format** parameter is specific to the particular Business Calendar panel.
