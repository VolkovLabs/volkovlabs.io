:::

The Business Calendar panel is a Grafana plugin that displays events in a stylish calendar format. The data can come from various data sources.

:::info Big Calendar
Starting from version 3.0.0, the Business Calendar Panel is completely rebuilt based on the [Big Calendar library](https://jquense.github.io/react-big-calendar/examples/index.html?path=/story/about-big-calendar--page). The previously existed Legacy mode has been retired.

The users preferred this library over the Legacy so often that we do not see the need to support the Legacy library anymore.

Starting from version 3.0.0 there will be only Big Calendar mode and the Legacy option disappears from the user choice.

:::

The [Big Calendar library](https://jquense.github.io/react-big-calendar/examples/index.html?path=/story/about-big-calendar--page) is an open-source powerful React library with various features designed to make any calendar intuitive, modern and efficient.
