:::

The Business Calendar panel is a Grafana plugin that displays events in a stylish calendar format. The data can come from various data sources.

:::info Big Calendar
Starting from version 3.0.0, the Business Calendar Panel is completely rebuilt based on the [Big Calendar library](https://jquense.github.io/react-big-calendar/examples/index.html?path=/story/about-big-calendar--page). The previously existed **Legacy** mode has been retired.

The users preferred this library over the **Legacy** so often that we do not see the need to support the **Legacy** library anymore.

Starting from version 3.0.0 there will be only **Big Calendar** mode and the Legacy option disappears from the user choice.
