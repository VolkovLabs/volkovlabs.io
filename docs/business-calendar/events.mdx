# Events

The first parameter of the **Events** category is **On click**:

- **Open Link** instructs the plugin to open an assigned link,
- **Show Details** instructs the plugin to open a drawer.

## Links

- `__data` is a reference to a retrieved data frame,
- `fields` is a reference to the retrieved data frame fields,
- `url` is a reference to a retrieved field name.

## Drawer with event details

A drawer is a pop-up window that opens on the right-hand side of your browser and displays event details.

## The Description format option

:::info Version

The Description format option feature is supported starting from version 3.5.0.

:::

You might want to apply formatting for better visual display when your event descriptions contain comprehensive details.

Your options for the description formatting are:

- **Inline**. You can use simple HTML formatting tags to have different font sizes, colors, etc.
- **Preformatted** is very similar to the HTML tag `<pre>`. Text is displayed in a fixed-width font, with spaces and line breaks preserved. The text is displayed "as is".

The illustration below shows how the same description text is interpreted depending on the selected **Description format** option.
