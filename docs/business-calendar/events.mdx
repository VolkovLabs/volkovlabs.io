# Events

The first parameter of the **Events** category is **On click**:

- **Open Link** instructs the plugin to open an assigned link,
- **Show Details** instructs the plugin to open a drawer.

## Links

The links are configured in the **Data links** category which is common for all Grafana plugins category. In the picture below the link is specified as follows:

- `__data` is a reference to a retrieved data frame,
- `fields` is a reference to the retrieved data frame fields,
- `url` is a reference to a retrieved field name.

## Drawer with event details

A drawer is a pop-up window that opens on the right-hand side of your browser and displays event details.

You can configure which data elements to show in the drawer by selecting them in the **Details info** parameter (see the first image on this page).
