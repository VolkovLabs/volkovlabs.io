# Variable Panel

The Variable panel builds on top of the regular dashboard variables. It allows you to have dashboard filters in a separate panel which you can place anywhere on the dashboard.

The variable panel offers you single- and multi-variable layouts along with an advanced Tree View.

With the latest updates, this panel allows users to seamlessly switch between dashboards which adds to the satisfying user experience.
