# Variable Panel

The Variable panel builds on top of the regular dashboard variables. 
It allows you to have dashboard filters in a separate panel which you can place anywhere on the dashboard.
At this moment the variable panel offers you single- and multi-variable layouts along with an advanced one - Tree View layout. 

:::info Development

The Variable Panel is under Grafana team review and expected to be available in the Grafana catalog any this or next week.
