# Business Variable

:::info announcement
The Variable panel joins the [Business Suite](/plugins/) for Grafana and with that gets an elevated name. Now, the same amazing open source plugin is called the Business Variable panel.

:::

The Business Variable panel builds on top of the regular dashboard variables. It allows you to have dashboard filters in a separate panel, which you can place anywhere on the dashboard.

The Business Variable panel offers many layouts with robust options, including an advanced TreeView layout.

With the latest updates, users can [switch between dashboards](/plugins/volkovlabs-variable-panel/redirect), which adds to the satisfying user experience.
