# Persistent Mode

:::info Version

Variable Panel supports redirects since version 2.3.1.

:::

This feature is applicable when Variable configured in Minimized and Button layouts. This mode could be turned on and off in the Variable panel options.

When **Enabled**, the selected values are stored in the browser's local storage. It comes in handy when one variable panel is controlled by the other variable panel.

For instance, in the illustration below, I have two variable panels. One displays countries and the other one displays states within the selected country. I chose **USA** in the first panel and then **IL** on the other panel.

Depending on the **Persistent** option value set for the **State** variable panel, the selected value is either <u>saved</u> in the browser for future use or <u>not</u>.
