# Tree View Groups

:::info Names
Levels (fields) from the data frame should have the same name as the variable.
:::

Multiple tree view groups allow selecting variables based on location, configuration, manufacturer, etc.

Each group has its level configuration and is based on the data from the data frames.

An additional option to display the variable name in front of the value can be enabled to provide additional context for the users.
