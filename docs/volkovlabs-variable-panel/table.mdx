# Table

The **Table** mode provides many variations, from the simplest basic single variable view to the most loaded TreeView.

## Single variable

With the minimum configuration effort, your Business Variable Panel might look like a simple list to select from. Whether or not multiple selections are allowed depends on the settings you choose in the variable configuration menu. In the example below, multiple selections and the **Include All** option are allowed.

## Single variable plus statuses

To add a status circle, follow these additional steps:

1. Connect the data source that retrieves two fields: a variable name and a numeric value.
2. Configure the threshold by specifying the color to data ranges.

/>

## Multiple variables view

This configuration is almost identical to the previous one. The differences are:

- The dashboard variables are connected to one another.

<Image

  src="/img/plugins/volkovlabs-variable-panel/four-vars.png"
/>

- Every level selection is a separate Business Variable panel.

## TreeView

The Multiple variables view can be displayed in a TreeView structure.

<Image
  title="Tree View plus circle statuses."
  src="/img/plugins/volkovlabs-variable-panel/treeview.png"
  width="15%"
/>

The **TreeView** display mode consists of _groups_ which usually are referred to as _tabs_.
Start with creating at least one **New Group** and assigning a dashboard variable to the **Select variable to display** parameter.

<Image
  title="For the TreeView, at minimum, add one group/tab and specify one dashboard variable name."
  src="/img/plugins/volkovlabs-variable-panel/start.png"
/>

To have tabs' names displayed you need to have at least two tabs added.

<Image
  title="Add at least two groups/tabs to have their names displayed."
  src="/img/plugins/volkovlabs-variable-panel/add-tabs.png"
/>

### TreeView Levels

To create a TreeView with levels, you need a dashboard variable for each level.

For instance, to have a four-level TreeView (Country->State->City->Device), you need four dashboard variables:

- The `country` is the first TreeView level.
- The `state` represents the second level. It gets updated with every `country` refresh.
- The `city` variable is for the third level. It gets updated with every `state` or `country` refresh.
- The `device` is for the fourth level. It gets updated with every `state`, `country`, or `city` refresh.

<Image
  title="Four dashboard variables to create a hierarchical TreeView structure."
  src="/img/plugins/volkovlabs-variable-panel/four-vars.png"
/>

Then in the Business Varibale panel options, add four TreeView levels. Be careful with the level names. They must match the names of the dashboard variables they represent.

  src="/img/plugins/volkovlabs-variable-panel/levels.png"
/>

Below is an example of the TreeView with status circles.

  src="/img/plugins/volkovlabs-variable-panel/treeview-edit.png"
/>

### Multi-level selection

In the **Groups** section, when the **Allow multi-level selection** parameter is enabled, choosing a root of the group automatically selects all elements belonging to this group.

<Image
  title="Selection of a group automatically selects all elements in this group."
  src="/img/plugins/volkovlabs-variable-panel/group-selection.png"
/>

### TreeView Groups/Tabs

A TreeView in the illustration below has two groups/tabs. You can add a new group/tab by using the **New Group** parameter.

<Image
  title="A TreeView group consists of levels."
  src="/img/plugins/volkovlabs-variable-panel/tabs.png"
/>

## Dashboard variable name display

An additional option to display the variable name in front of the value can be enabled to provide additional context for the users.

<Image
  title="The variable names can be made visible by using the Display variable name parameter."

## Favorites

:::info Unique
Favorites are stored in a web browser and are unique for each user.

## Search

### Clean filter value button

:::info Version

The Business Variable Panel supports this feature starting from version 2.2.0.

:::

It is a small, but very nice feature. Once you start typing in the search text field, you can remove all entered symbols by using an X button appearing at the far-right corner of the search text.

<Image
  title="Clean filter value button in the search field."

  width="60%"
/>

### Always Visible Search option

:::info Version

The Business Variable Panel supports this feature starting from version 2.2.0.

:::

The ability to hide a search text area can be taken away from users by using the **Always Visible search** option.

When it is **Disabled**, the funnel icon is shown on the dashboard. By clicking on the funnel icon, users can alternate between hiding and showing the search text area.

When it is **Enabled**, the funnel icon is hidden and users are not capable of hiding the search text area.

## Total and selected values count

:::info Version

The Business Variable Panel supports this feature starting from version 3.0.0.

:::

In the **Table** display mode, you can now choose to **Display total and selected values count for multi-select variables**. The **Header** must be in the **Display** mode to see the new parameter.

This parameter is the enable/disable type. The total count appears next to the header in a gray font color where the first number indicates how many values are selected and the second how many are available for selection in total.

<Image
  title="Total and selected values on the dashboard."
  src="/img/blog/2024-06-01-variable-panel-3.0.0/total.png"
/>

## Tab auto-grouping

:::info Version

The Business Variable Panel supports this feature starting from version 3.0.0.

:::

The ability to auto group tab adds even more sophistication to the Business Variable panel. When too many tabs are located side by side, the panel collects the overflowing tabs and shows the three vertical dots instead. Upon clicking on the dots, a user sees the rest of the tabs in a drop-down for selection.

The Business Variable panel shifts the selected tab on the very left among all other tabs.

<Image
  title="Auto tab grouping and shifting the selected tab to the left."

## Selected tab preservation

:::info Version

The Business Variable Panel supports this feature starting from version 3.0.0.

:::

You might have the cloned Business Variable panel across many dashboards. With that, a user can [switch to a different dashboard](/blog/variable-panel-2.2.0-20231130/#dashboard-redirect-option) without realizing it. To enhance the user experience even further, you can now save the selected tab while redirecting a user and open a new dashboard with the tab that the user selected prior.

To configure the preservation of the selected tab, you need the **Selected group id** parameter from the **Groups** section. Choose a unique word and specify it across all dashboards where you have the Business Variable panel and need to preserve the selected tab.

In the illustration below, you can see three different dashboards with an identical Business Variable panel on each. All three Business Variable panels have the same word _device_ in the **Selected group id** parameter.

## Advanced. Select dependent variable to reset

:::info Version

The Business Variable Panel supports this feature starting from version 3.0.0.

:::

The **Select dependent variable to reset** option is for advanced Business Variable panel users. This option is created to jump over some default Grafana functionality.

Grafana saves the dashboard variable values for better performance and reuses them whenever possible. This is majorly helpful. However, there are some scenarios when it is not aligned with the best user experience.

To better understand the new parameter, first, outline the participating concepts:

- _dashboard variable_,
- _dashboard variable query_,
- _selected current value_,
- _dashboard variable refresh/update_,
- _dashboard variable reset_.

A [_dashboard variable_](/grafana/variables/) usually is a set of values retrieved following the rules set by a dashboard developer. Though, there could be many possible ways to set the rules, for simplicity, let's call them all a _dashboard variable query_.

A _dashboard variable_ might have a _selected current value_ (or values).

A _dashboard variable refresh/update_ is when the _dashboard variable query_ is called to retrieve the whole set of values. If previously the _selected current value_ existed, Grafana specifies it as well right after the refresh/update.

Thus, there are two steps in the _dashboard variable refresh/update_.

The **Select dependent variable to reset** option instructs Grafana to perform only the first step: to rerun the _dashboard variable query_ and omit the second step, meaning NOT to assign a _selected current value_.

The first step without the second is called _dashboard variable reset_.

With all that in mind, we can define what **Select dependent variable to reset** option does.

It links two _dashboard variables_ and instructs Grafana to reset one of them after the value of the first one is changed.

The two scenarios below provide use-case examples of when the _dashboard variable reset_ is needed.

### Scenario 1

In this scenario, we have two dashboard variables:

- `device` which is populated by the query

```sql
 select name from device_time;
```

- `type` which is populated by the query that is dependent on the first variable

```
select value from device_time where name='$device';
```

<Image
  title="Two dashboard variables. One is dependent on the other."
  src="/img/blog/2024-06-01-variable-panel-3.0.0/reset-var.png"
/>

With this configuration, whenever the `device` variable is updated (a value is selected in the dashboard drop-down, etc.), the other variable `type` automatically gets refreshed/updated. That means that the query to populate the `type` variable is run with every `device` variable value update.

Let's say that some of the values of the `type` variable overlap. In the example below, we have:

```text
 - device 1, type in ('1', '2', '3'),
 - device 2, type in ('2', '3'),
 - device 3, type in ('3'),
```

The value '3' is common for all devices. The value '2' is shared by device 1 and device 2 and the value '1' is unique for the first device.

<Image
  title="Some of the values of the `type` variable overlap between devices."
  src="/img/blog/2024-06-01-variable-panel-3.0.0/values.png"
/>

If you set `type` to '3', then with switching devices in the `device` variable, you will always see '3' in the `type` variable. The `type` variable gets refreshed/updated (the underlying query is rerun), and following that Grafana will set it to '3' (to the previously selected value).

<Image
  title="In case of the overlapping values, Grafana sets the common value."
  src="/img/blog/2024-06-01-variable-panel-3.0.0/reset-no.gif"
  width="60%"
/>

If you set `type` to 1 (not overlapping value, the value '1' is unique to one device), then with every switch of the `device` variable, the `type` gets refreshed/updated (the underlying query is rerun) and the first retrieved value is displayed. Grafana can not set to the value selected previously since there is no such value for device 2, and for device 3.

<Image
  title="In case of no overlapping values, the first from the query result is displayed."
  src="/img/blog/2024-06-01-variable-panel-3.0.0/reset-yes.gif"
  width="60%"
/>

The **Select dependent variable to reset** parameter ensures that overlapping values do not matter.

The variable name you specify in the **Select dependent variable to reset** always will be _reset_ and the value to display will be taken from the first retrieved, not from the previous selections.

### Scenario 2

Variables do not have to depend on each other. In this scenario, the `type` variable has the **Custom** type. The values are specified directly separated by a comma.

<Image
  title="Two independent dashboard variables."
  src="/img/blog/2024-06-01-variable-panel-3.0.0/comma.png"
/>

With the **Custom** dashboard variable type, two dashboard variables are not linked in any way and act independently. This means the refresh/update of the `device` variable does nothing to the `type` variable.

In this scenario, using the new **Select dependent variable to reset** parameter is the only option to trigger the `type` variable reset following the `device` variable refresh/update.
