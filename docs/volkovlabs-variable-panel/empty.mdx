# Empty value in Multi-value

:::info Version
The empty value option was introduced in version 2.0.0.
:::

This feature works for the **Minimize** and **Button** display modes.

Before this feature was introduced there was no way to unselect all values. A user always had to have something selected after they made the first selection.

For this feature to work, you must enable the **Allow empty value** parameter in the **Values** section.
