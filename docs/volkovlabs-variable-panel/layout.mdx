## Regular visualization panel versus variable panel

The Variable Panel works with your dashboard variables to make them more user-friendly. The Variable Panel displays your dashboard variable directly on your dashboard, you can place it anywhere and even enable the Sticky option to ensure the Variable Panel is always in sight for the user and never gets scrolled over.

Below are two schemas for comparison. One highlights the data flow for any regular Grafana visualization panel. Usually, a panel requires a data source that would fetch the data for further displaying by the panel.

The Variable Panel does not require a data source. The Variable Panel works with your dashboard variable which already is a set of values. So, in a way, the Variable Panel uses your dashboard variable as a data source.

However, optionally, the data source can be used for two purposes:

- First, if you would like to have a color status next to your variable, you would need a numeric value to feed into the threshold.
- Second, if you like to display your variable in the Tree View format, ensure to provide node relation via the connected data source.

## Variable panel examples

Below we provide some examples of what the panel might look like along with the configuration you would need to set in Edit mode.

### Basic View(Single variable)

With the minimum configuration effort, your Variable Panel might look like as a simlpe list to select from. Whether or not Multiple selections are allowed depends on the settings you choose in the variable configuration menu. In my example below, I allowed multiple selections and Inclide All option.

### Basic View(Single variable) plus statuses

If you like to add a status circle, then in addition to the basic setup steps:

1. Connect the data source with a query where you select a variable name and a numeric value.
2. Configure the threshold by specifying the color to data ranges.

### Multiple variables View

This configuration is identical to the previous one. The only difference is that for every dashboard variable, you add a separate variable panel.

### Tree View

For the Tree View, you need a query returning parent-child connections. In that query, ensure the column aliases are identical to the variable names.
