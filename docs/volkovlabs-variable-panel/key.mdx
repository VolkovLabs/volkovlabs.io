# Key-values format in Variables

A Grafana variable can be composed of a key and value to make it possible to join data sets by IDs(key) while displaying user-friendly names(value). All display modes support this feature.

In the illustration below, screen 1, the `city` variable is created with three key-value pairs.

```text
Chicago:1, New York:2, Tampa:3
```

Screen 2 is a dashboard view where an end-user sees only city names. After the selection is made (here, New York:2), the variable carries a value equal to 2.

From there the `city` variable's value can be used in the queries for other panels, screen 3.
