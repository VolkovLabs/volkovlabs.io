# Input Text Box

The input text box is supported in the **Table** and **Minimize** display modes.

In the **Table** display mode, you can use the **Sticky position** option to make the Business Variable panel stay in sight when scrolling the dashboard.

## Enter the key for the Text Box type

Hitting the enter key after typing a text value in the Text box variable type triggers the dashboard refresh.

Before implementing this feature, a user had to use a mouse cursor to click outside the box for the variable to take effect.
