## Enter the key for the Text Box type

:::info Version

The Business Variable Panel supports this feature starting from version 2.0.0.

Hitting the enter key after typing a text value in the Text box variable type triggers the dashboard refresh. Before implementing this feature, a user had to use a mouse cursor to click outside the box for the variable to take effect.
