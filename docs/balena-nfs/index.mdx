## Requirements

- **balenaOS 2.105.19** is required for Nvidia Jetson AGX Orin Devkit with NFS version 4.
- **balenaOS 2.99.27+rev1** is required for NFS version 4.
- **balenaOS 2.98** is required for NFS version 3.

## Highlights

- Includes a NFS Server build on top of the PostgreSQL Alpine image using OpenRC to manage NFS services.
- Supports various environment variables to specify storage label, mount point, etc.
- Includes a NFS Client build on top of the NGINX Alpine image using custom Entrypoint script to mount NFS export.
- Provides Grafana Dashboard to manage running services and display configuration using Supervisor API. Default Grafana username and password is **admin/admin**.
- Supports NFS version 4 and version 3.
- Allows to set NFS in `sync` or `async` modes.
