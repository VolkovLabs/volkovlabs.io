# Sort by Status

You can allow users to sort the Business Variable panel values based on the data retrieved from the data source.

For that set **Sort by Status** option to **Enabled** and specify:

- **Field with variable values**. That field is used to map the data frame with the variable panel values.
- **Field with status values**. It should be a numeric format, the values are used for sorting.

The sorting button alternates between three modes when a user clicks.

- Neutral. The variable panel is in this state after the page loads and after each page refresh.
- Descending.
- Ascending.
