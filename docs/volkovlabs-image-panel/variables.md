# Variables

To learn about three types of variables, watch the following video: [Three types of Grafana's variables](/plugins/grafana/#dashboard-global-and-environment-variables)

The Base64 Image/Video/Audio/PDF visualization panel supports `dashboard` and `global` variables in the panel option `Image URL`.

## Global Variables

You can find [global built-in variables](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/variables/variable-types/global-variables/) in the Grafana documentation.
