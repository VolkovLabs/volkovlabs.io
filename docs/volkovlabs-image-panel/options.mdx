  - **Full Screen**. This enables one button that allows your image to be opened in full-screen mode.

## Width and Height

The **Width** and **Height** sections allow control of the image size on the dashboard.

- **Panel**. The width or height will fit the current panel size.
- **Original**. The width or height will be taken from the original file.
- **Custom**. Here you can either take the sizing from the connected data frame field or give a specific number in pixels.

  width="70%"
/>

## Image

In the **Image** section there is one drop-down parameter **Scale Algorithm** to specify how scaling of the image should be done. We have three options to choose from:

- **Auto**. A browser chooses the best available algorithm.
- **Crisp Edges**. The image is scaled with an algorithm that preserves contrast and edges in the image. Generally intended for images such as pixel art or line drawings, no blurring or color smoothing occurs.
- **Pixelated**. The image is scaled with the "nearest neighbor" or similar algorithm, preserving a "pixelated" look as the image changes in size.

:::info
The **Crisp Edges** option is not supported in all browsers: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/image-rendering

## Video/Audio

In the **Video/Audio** section, there are specific to these formats parameters:

- **Controls**. **Enabled** instructs the panel to display the video and audio controls.
- **Auto Play**. When **Enabled**, the video and audio automatically start playing without sound.
- **Infinity Play**. With **Enabled**, the file plays in an endless loop.
