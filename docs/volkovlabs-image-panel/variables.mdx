# Variables

The Business Media panel supports dashboard and global variables in the `Image URL` panel option.

These three types of variables are explained in our [Grafana Crash Course](/grafana/variables).

## Example of dashboard variable in the Base64 panel

Below you can find an example of how a dashboard variable can be used to dynamically determine which file to display on the panel. The following blog post describes a project that integrates three open source plugins to solve the task of uploading a file into a database and then immediately showing what has been uploaded.

The plugins used in the example are:

- [The Data Manipulation](/plugins/business-forms/) to provide with the File type element for file upload.
- [The Variable panel](/plugins/volkovlabs-variable-panel/) to provide a choice of what file to display.
- The Business Media panel to display a selected file.

If you are a visual style learner, you can watch the video. It covers the same ground.
