# Data Sources

Base64 Image/Video/Audio/PDF Panel retrieves media data from the connected data source. You can use any suitable option to retrieve data in the Base64 format.

A static data source is the quickest way to get started. PostgreSQL is also an excellent choice.

## Static data source

You can use a static data source to retrieve any supported Base64 formats and render them on your Grafana dashboard.

:::info Limitation

The static data source is an option for storing and retrieving small and medium-sized files. If you get the `413 Request Entity Too Long` error, it means that you have exceeded Grafana limits. You need to switch to the database or storage data source; PostgreSQL is an excellent choice for this.

:::

## PostgreSQL

For media files, the data source must return Base64 encoded file content and may return a format definition such as `data:video/mp4;base64,ENCODED-CONTENT`.

```
SELECT
  concat(
    'data:video/mp4;base64,',
    encode(video, 'base64')
  ) as video
from
  videos
where
  name = 'flow';
```

The PostgreSQL database includes functions for working with the Base64 format.

```sql
SELECT CONVERT_FROM (DECODE('SGVsbG8gV29ybGQh', 'BASE64'), 'UTF-8');
SELECT ENCODE (CONVERT_TO('Hello World!', 'UTF-8'), 'BASE64');
```

### Loading media files into the database

Create tables to store images, video, and audio files.

<Code

  language="sql"
/>

Load PDF, PNG, MP4, MP3, and other supported file formats into your database using the Node.js script.

<Code
  url="https://github.com/VolkovLabs/volkovlabs-image-panel/blob/main/postgres/load.ts"
  language="js"
