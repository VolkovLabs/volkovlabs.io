# Bootstrap

Thanks to our community member [Josiah Solomon](https://github.com/yosiasz) for the provided solution.

Use the following external Bootstrap and CSS libraries:

```md
https://esm.sh/bootstrap@5.0.2

https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css
```

:::info

Grafana's edit mode might prevent displaying bootstrap framework. Save and check the result on the dashboard.

## Code to copy

Into the **Content** or **Default Content**:

```html
<div class="accordion" id="accordionExample">
  <div class="accordion-item">
    <h2 class="accordion-header" id="headingOne">
      <button
        class="accordion-button"
        type="button"
        data-bs-toggle="collapse"
        data-bs-target="#collapseOne"
        aria-expanded="true"
        aria-controls="collapseOne"
      >
        Accordion Item #1
      </button>
    </h2>
    <div
      id="collapseOne"
      class="accordion-collapse collapse show"
      aria-labelledby="headingOne"
      data-bs-parent="#accordionExample"
    >
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <strong>This is the first item's accordion body.</strong> It is shown by
        default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we
        use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance,
        as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify
        any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's
        also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the
        <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="accordion-item">
    <h2 class="accordion-header" id="headingTwo">
      <button

        <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden
