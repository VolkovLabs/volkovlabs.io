# Use cases

:::info Version

Since in Grafana 11, the functionality of external JavaScript resources is deprecated, we removed the **External Resource**->**Scripts** parameter. You can import the JavaScript library directly in the code.

The Business Text panel supports the JavaScript libraries import in the **Before content rendering** starting from version 5.3.0.

:::

You can import the external JavaScript libraries in both parameters: **Before content rendering** and **After content ready**.

The Business Text panel enables the loading of additional JavaScript using external URLs like CDN (Content Delivery Network). Use that functionality to execute JavaScript functions in the [JavaScript Code](/plugins/business-text/code) editor.

## Public folder

To prevent the loading of third-party URLs, you can store CSS and JS files in the public folder on a Grafana instance.

- To load from external Grafana instance use `https://GRAFANA-URL/public/grafanaCSS.css`.
- From local Grafana instance use `/public/grafanaCSS.css`.

## External JavaScript resources

Below, you can find a collection of breathtaking use cases, the perfect examples of using external JavaScript libraries in the Business Text plugin.

:::info Render template parameter

Use **All rows** or **All data** template to execute template only once. With **Every row**, the **Content** will be applied to every row of retrieved data. Even though the data frames of the specified data source are not used, still the plugin runs the code as many times as the number of rows is retrieved.
