# Basic configuration

The Business Calendar panel allows you to load events from any data source and display them on your Grafana dashboard.

## The Data section

For the plugin to work, you must provide a mapping for two mandatory data elements(**Text** and **Start time**). You also can define optional fields to make your calendar more informative.

| Field       | Required | Description                                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Text        | **Yes**  | Event title. By default, the first text field is used.                                                                             |
| Description | No       | Event description.                                                                                                                 |
| Location    | No       | Event location.                                                                                                                    |
| Start time  | **Yes**  | Event start time. By default, the first time field is used.                                                                        |
| End time    | No       | Event end time.                                                                                                                    |
| Labels      | No       | Event labels. Supports multiple comma-separated values.                                                                            |
| Color       | No       | Event background color. Specify a number field. Grafana will color the event background according to the specified **Thresholds**. |

## Week Start

For the **Work** and **Work Week** layouts, the plugin considers the Grafana system settings when choosing the first day of the week - Saturday, Sunday, or Monday, or uses the default day from Grafana settings.
