# Coloring Events

You may color events using the Business Calendar Panel plugin for improving their visual perception on the calendar layout. Colors can be used to represent distinct event types, different priorities, and so on.

You can color events based on the following:

- Color field
- Frame ID
- Event ID

You can color events in different tones based on whether their values fall within a specific threshold. In addition, you can choose a classic color palette in the plugin's options.
