# Legacy calendar

The legacy calendar is a native implementation of the calendar based on custom components. Unlike Big Calendar, it does not provide a toolbar and has limited support for week and day views.

The legacy calendar allows you to display events from several months and scroll through them. Big Calendar is restricted to the selected time period (month, week, or day).
