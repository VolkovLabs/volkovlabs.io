# Legacy Calendar

The Legacy Calendar is a native implementation of the calendar panel based on the custom components. Compare to the Big Calendar it does not provide a toolbar and has limited support of week and day layouts.

The legacy Calendar allows you to display multi months of events by scrolling. The Big Calendar is limited to the selected period of Month, Week and Day.
