# Events

The first parameter of the **Events** section is **On click**:

- **Open Link** instructs the plugin to open an assigned link,
- **Show Details** instructs the plugin to open a drawer.

## Links

The links are configured in the **Data links** section which is common for all Grafana plugins section. In the picture below the link is specified as follows:

- `__data` is a reference to a retrieved data frame,
- `fields` is a reference to the retrieved data frame fields,
- `url` is a reference to a retrieved field name.

## Drawers / Event details

A drawer is a pop-up window that opens on the right-hand side of your browser and displays event details.
