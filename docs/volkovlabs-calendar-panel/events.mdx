# Events

Business Calendar Panel allows you to load events from any data source and display them on your Grafana dashboard.

## Configuration

Define the required and optional fields in the plugin's options to visualize events on the Grafana dashboard.

| Field       | Required | Description                                                 |
| ----------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Text        | Yes      | Event title. By default, the first text field is used.      |
| Start time  | Yes      | Event start time. By default, the first time field is used. |
| Description | No       | Event description.                                          |
| End time    | No       | Event end time.                                             |
| Labels      | No       | Event labels. Supports multiple comma-separated values.     |
| Color       | No       | Event color.                                                |

## Duration

Events are categorized into four types:

1. **Instantaneous** - an event having only the start time.
1. **Continuing** - an event having the start and end time.
1. **Multi-day** - an event having a start and end time and lasting for two days or more.
1. **Ongoing** - an event having the start time without the end time.
