# Events

The Calendar visualization panel allows displaying events from any data source. You can define fields in the panel's options.

| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Text        | Field to use as event text. Defaults to the first text field.           |
| Description | Field to use as event description.                                      |
| Start time  | Field to use as the event start time. Defaults to the first-time field. |
| End time    | Field to use as event end time.                                         |
| Labels      | Fields to use as event labels.                                          |

## Duration

- If the event has only the Start time configured, events are considered instantaneous.
- If the event has Start and End time, events are considered to have a duration.
- Any events that are missing an End time are considered ongoing.
