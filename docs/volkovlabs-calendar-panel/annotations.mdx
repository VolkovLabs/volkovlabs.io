# Annotations

The Calendar Panel plugin allows you to display and filter Grafana annotations.

You can adjust the display settings as follows:

- **Type**: allows you to display both alerts and annotations, alerts only, or annotations only.
- **Max limit**: allows you to set the maximum number of annotations to display between 100 to 2,000.
