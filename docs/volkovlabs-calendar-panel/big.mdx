# Big Calendar

Big Calendar is an upgraded implementation of the calendar component built based on the powerful React library.

It introduces a multi-language toolbar that allows you to:

1. Switch between the Month, Week, and Day views.
2. Switch back to today's events.
3. Display events from the previous and subsequent time ranges.
