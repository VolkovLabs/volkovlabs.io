# Big Calendar

The Big Calendar is a new implementation of the calendar panel based on the powerful React library.

It introduces a multi-language toolbar that allows to:

1. Switch between Month, Week and Day layouts.
2. Get back to Today.
3. Display events from the previous and next selected time range.
