# Business Media

You can use the Static data source to store any supported base64-encoded media files on your Grafana dashboard.

:::info Limitation

The Static Data Source is an excellent solution for not huge sizes. If you get a `413 Request Entity Too Long` error, the Grafana limit is reached.

In this case, consider using a database/storage data source. [PostgreSQL is a good choice](/blog/grafana-postgresql-20230123/).

:::

## Fields

String field `img` to store a base64 encoded media file with or without definition `data:image/IMAGE-FORMAT;base64,ENCODED-CONTENT`.
