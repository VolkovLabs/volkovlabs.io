## Introduction

The Balena Application plugin for Grafana allows to display device information and manage services using Balena Supervisor API.

Working in a productive alliance, Balena, Grafana, and the Balena Application plugin simplify managing a network of non-homogenous IoT devices. If needed, a device could be made accessible directly, which means internet access is not required.

## Balena Supervisor

The balena Supervisor is balena's agent that runs on devices. Its main role is to ensure your app is running, and keep communications with the balenaCloud API server.

The Supervisor has its own [set of APIs](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/supervisor/supervisor-api/) providing means for services to communicate and execute some special actions that affect the host OS or the services itself.
