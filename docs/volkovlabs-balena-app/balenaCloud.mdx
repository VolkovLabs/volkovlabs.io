# balenaCloud

Our custom Grafana build with the Balena Application plugin can be [deployed directly to balenaCloud](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/deploy?repoUrl=https://github.com/volkovlabs/volkovlabs-balena-app).

We recommend adding it to your `docker-compose.yml` together with NGINX reverse proxy (example configuration in the repository):

```yaml reference
https://github.com/VolkovLabs/volkovlabs-balena-app/blob/main/docker-compose.yml
```

The default Grafana username and password is **admin/admin**.

You can learn more about balena labels in the [Documentation](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/supervisor/docker-compose/#labels).

## IoT Framework

This video highlights just one example of many possible solutions when you can combine balena for IoT networking and Grafana with open-source one-click-away features.
