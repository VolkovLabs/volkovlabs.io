# Getting Started

The Grafana community is constantly growing, and we are happy to welcome new professionals onboard this flexible and powerful tool.

Grafana has been of interest to deep technology experts in the recent past. Although, lately, more and more people from different backgrounds and skill sets are turning heads toward it.

## Installation

This video is for anyone who just started with Grafana and wondering what the installation process looks like. The most efficient and cleanest option is to use Grafana in a docker container.

## Storage partner

People often ask, What is our database of choice to work with Grafana? We say PostgreSQL with Timescale.

Our rationale is in this video.

## Replicate and reuse panels

The Library panels feature was introduced in Grafana 8 and updated in Grafana 9. We loved it so much that decided to create a whole video about it.
