# Variables

The topic of variables in Grafana has generated a myriad of questions lately. In short, there are three types of variables:

- Dashboard
- Global
- Environment

We created this video to structure the subject and speed up the learning curve for Grafana enthusiasts.

## Dashboard

Dashboard variables capture the values within one dashboard. They are usually used for filter functionality.

## Global

Global variables are Grafana settings you can retrieve and use on your dashboards.

| Variable          | Description                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `${__dashboard}`  | Name of the current dashboard.            |
| `${__from}`       | From of Time Range in epoch milliseconds. |
| `${__interval}`   | Parameter to group by time.               |
| `${__org.name}`   | Name of the current organization.         |
| `${__org}`        | Id of the current organization.           |
| `${__to}`         | To of Time Range in epoch milliseconds.   |
| `${__user.email}` | Email for the current user.               |
| `${__user.id}`    | Id of the current user.                   |
| `${__user.login}` | Login handle of the current user.         |

You can find [all the global built-in variables](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/variables/variable-types/global-variables/) in the Grafana documentation.

## Environment

Environment variables are the variables from the Grafana environment (operating system and/or device) where Grafana is installed.

Conventionally those variables are off-limits, but with the [Environment data source](/plugins/volkovlabs-env-datasource), access to the environment variables is possible!

## Summary

We published a blog post to provide more information for each type of variable with examples.
