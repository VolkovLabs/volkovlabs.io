## Blog posts

We are always on the lookout for more ways to customize Grafana. Currently, we have two blog posts published explaining various customization commands. 

The posts complement each other nicely. The docker file contains all
available customization instructions.

## Dockerfile

Our customization is done in the Dockerfile and it can be easily replicated for host installation.

We constantly update our Docker builds based on the latest version of Grafana.
