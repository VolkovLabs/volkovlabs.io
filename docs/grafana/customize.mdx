# Customize Grafana interface

To make the Grafana dashboard look more like your native application, you can customize the fundamental graphical elements like the login page, background, application icon, etc.
Watch this video for more details.

You can read about Grafana customization in the blog post [How to customize the Grafana user interface](/blog/how-to-customize-the-grafana-user-interface-8d70a42dc2b6).

## Dockerfile

Our customization is done in the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/VolkovLabs/volkovlabs-app/blob/main/Dockerfile) and it can be easily replicated for host installation.

```docker reference
https://github.com/VolkovLabs/volkovlabs-app/blob/main/Dockerfile
```

We constantly update our Docker builds based on the latest version of Grafana.
