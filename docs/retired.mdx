# Retired Plugins

This page provides information about plugins that have been discontinued as part of our commitment to aligning with the latest Grafana standards and industry best practices.

Below, you'll find details on retired plugins, the reasons for their retirement, and step-by-step migration guidance to ensure your dashboards continue to function seamlessly.

## Why Plugins Are Retired

Volkov Labs retires plugins periodically to:

- Prioritize development of modern, scalable solutions.
- Adapt to evolving Grafana compatibility and API requirements.
- Improve security and performance based on user feedback and industry trends.

:::info Important Note
Retired plugins no longer receive updates, bug fixes, or technical support. We strongly recommend migrating to the suggested alternatives to ensure optimal functionality and security.

## List of Retired Plugins

### Business News

- **Retirement Date**: July 12, 2025
- **Last Supported Version**: 4.3.0 (compatible with Grafana 11 and earlier)

- **Recommended Alternative**: Migrate to the Infinity Data Source (`grafana-infinity-datasource`) for enhanced support of news feeds and other data sources.

### Business Satellite

- **Retirement Date**: July 12, 2025
- **Last Supported Version**: 3.5.0 (compatible with Grafana 11 and earlier)
- **Reason for Retirement**: Limited usage and overlap with more versatile alternatives. The Infinity Data Source provides a more robust and flexible solution for similar use cases.
- **Recommended Alternative**: Migrate to the Infinity Data Source (`grafana-infinity-datasource`) for enhanced support of your data and other data sources.

## Migration Guidance

To ensure a smooth transition away from retired plugins, follow the detailed steps below for each plugin. These instructions are designed to minimize downtime and maintain dashboard functionality.

### Migrating from Business News to Infinity Data Source

1. **Check Compatibility**: Ensure your Grafana instance is running version 11 or 12 to support the Infinity Data Source.
2. **Install the Infinity Plugin**: Install the `grafana-infinity-datasource` plugin via the Grafana CLI or the Plugins Catalog.
   ```bash
   grafana-cli plugins install grafana-infinity-datasource
   ```
3. **Update Dashboard Configurations**: Open your dashboards and update the data source settings. Map existing Business News queries to equivalent formats supported by Infinity, such as JSON, CSV, or direct API endpoints.
4. **Test in a Staging Environment**: Validate the updated dashboards in a non-production environment to confirm data accuracy and visualization integrity.
5. **Remove the Old Data Source**: Once migration is complete and verified, uninstall the Business News Data Source from your Grafana instance to avoid conflicts.
