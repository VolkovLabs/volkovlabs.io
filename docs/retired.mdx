# Retired Plugins

This page details plugins that have been discontinued to ensure our ecosystem remains aligned with the latest Grafana standards and industry best practices. Below, youâ€™ll find information on retired plugins, reasons for retirement, and migration guidance to keep your dashboards running smoothly.

## Why Plugins Are Retired

Volkov Labs periodically retires plugins to:

- Focus development on modern, scalable solutions.
- Address evolving Grafana compatibility requirements.
- Enhance security and performance based on community feedback.

:::info Updates
Retired plugins no longer receive updates, bug fixes, or support. We recommend migrating to recommended alternatives to maintain optimal functionality.

## List of Retired Plugins

### Business News Data Source

- **Retirement Date**: July 12, 2025
- **Last Supported Version**: 4.3.0 (compatible with Grafana 11 and earlier)
- **Reason for Retirement**: Limited use. The Infinity data source offers a more robust replacement.
- **Migration Path**: Transition to the Infinity data source (`grafana-infinity-datasource`) for continued news and data feed support.

## Migration Guidance

To ensure a seamless transition, follow these steps for each retired plugin:

### Migrating from Business News Data Source to Infinity Data Source

1. **Verify Compatibility**: Confirm your Grafana instance is updated to version 11 or 12.
2. **Install Infinity Plugin**: Use the Grafana CLI or Plugins Catalog to install `grafana-infinity-datasource`.
   ```
   grafana cli plugins install grafana-infinity-datasource
   ```
3. **Reconfigure Dashboards**: Update data source settings in your dashboards, mapping Business News queries to Infinity-supported formats (e.g., JSON, CSV, or API endpoints).
4. **Test Configuration**: Validate dashboards in a staging environment to ensure data integrity.
5. **Decommission Old Source**: Remove the Business News data source from your setup post-migration.

### General Tips

- Backup your current dashboards before migration.
- Test migrated dashboards thoroughly to avoid data discrepancies.
