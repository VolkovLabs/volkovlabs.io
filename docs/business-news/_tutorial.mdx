## Tutorial

This is a very detailed tutorial in which Daria explains what RSS/Atom format is and how to find appropriate links for further usage. She then demonstrates how to install and configure the Business News data source on your Grafana dashboard. She touches upon Grafana's transformations to show little data transformation tricks.

The tutorial was created two years ago, and since then, we significantly improved the Business News data source. The new video is on our road map.
