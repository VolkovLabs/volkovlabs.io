# Business News

:::warning Announcement
We are announcing the retirement of the Business News data source, effective immediately, as part of our ongoing effort to streamline and modernize our Grafana plugin ecosystem. To ensure uninterrupted access to news and data feeds, we strongly recommend migrating to the Infinity data source, a robust and versatile replacement designed to meet your monitoring and visualization needs.

### Why This Change?

The retirement aligns with industry trends toward more integrated and scalable data solutions, addressing the complexities of managing fragmented data sources. The Infinity data source offers enhanced flexibility, supporting a wide range of data formats and real-time updates, making it an ideal choice for business analytics and dashboards.
:::

The Business News data source is a plugin for Grafana that retrieves RSS and Atom feeds and allows visualizing them using Business Text and other panels.

## Requirements

- Business News data source 4.X requires **Grafana 10.1** or **Grafana 11**.
- RSS/Atom data source 3.X requires **Grafana 9** or **Grafana 10**.
- RSS/Atom data source 2.X requires **Grafana 8.5** or **Grafana 9**.
- RSS/Atom data source 1.X requires **Grafana 8**.

<GettingStarted />

## Highlights

- Supports RSS 2.0, RSS 1.0 and Atom.
- Works with Dynamic Text visualization panel.
- Returns Channel (Feed) data, Items (Entries) or both as separate data frames.
- Extract and parse as additional fields:
  - Image from Meta.
  - H4 and Image from the Encoded content.
  - Media:Group for YouTube.
- Filter items/entries based on the selected Time Range.
- Allows specifying Query parameters with dashboard variables.

Below is the example where the dashboard combines five Business News data sources each paired with the [Business Text panel](/plugins/business-text/). The [Business Variable panel](/plugins/business-variable/) (#1) provides a switch between Volkov Labs, Grafana and News channel.
