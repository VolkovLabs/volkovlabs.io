# Business Satellite

:::warning Announcement
We are announcing the retirement of the Business Satellite data source, effective as of today, July 12, 2025, as part of our commitment to maintaining a modern and efficient Grafana plugin ecosystem. To ensure continued access to your data and analytics, we strongly recommend migrating to the Infinity data source, a powerful and flexible alternative designed to meet your evolving needs.

### Why This Change?

The retirement of the Business Satellite data source reflects our focus on consolidating resources toward scalable, future-proof solutions. The Infinity data source provides enhanced support for diverse data formats, real-time updates, and seamless integration with Grafana 11 and 12, addressing limitations in the older plugin.
:::

The Business Satellite data source for Grafana allows retrieving data from local and remote Grafana instances via HTTP API.

## Requirements

- Grafana HTTP API data source 2.X requires **Grafana 9** and **Grafana 10**.
- Grafana HTTP API data source 1.X requires **Grafana 8.5** and **Grafana 9**.
