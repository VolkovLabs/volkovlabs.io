## Tutorial

Daria starts with Grafana widgets, explaining its limitations and how with the Business Satellite data source you can have flexible visualizations of anything stored in the Grafana central repository (settings, metadata, alerts, and annotations). She touches upon Grafana's transformations to show little data transformation tricks.

Towards the end, she demonstrates how the Business Satellite data source supports the regex pattern conditions to let you work with the cherry-picked data elements you need.
