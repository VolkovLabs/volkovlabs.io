# Volkov Labs App

The Volkov Labs App includes a Docker image with customized Grafana and an Application plugin with information about Volkov Labs maintained plugins.

We share this project with the community as an example of how to create [a customized Docker image with included Application plugin and provisioning](https://github.com/volkovlabs/volkovlabs-app).

## Customization

Months of work bundled with deep expertise nicely wrapped into a 7-minute long video revealing simple steps to customize Grafana. In this tutorial, we answered all community questions we collected to this moment.
