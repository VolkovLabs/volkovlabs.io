# Annotations

:::info Version

Annotations are supported by the Apache ECharts visualization panel starting from version 4.3.0.

:::

Annotations is an umbrella term that includes many Grafana artifacts.

- Native Annotations
- Alerts
- Annotations Queries

We explained the differences and created a how-to tutorial in the [Grafana Crash Course](/grafana/annotations).

## Mark Lines

Annotations in Apache ECharts are displayed using mark lines. Data for mark lines should be retrieved from the `data.annotations`.
