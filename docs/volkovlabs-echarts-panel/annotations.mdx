# Annotations

:::info Version

Apache ECharts Panel supports annotations since version 4.3.0.

:::

Annotations is an umbrella term that includes several Grafana artifacts, as follows:

- Native Annotations
- Alerts
- Annotations Queries

We explained the differences between different types of annotations in the how-to tutorial within our [Grafana Crash Course](/grafana/annotations).

## Mark Lines

Apache ECharts Panel displays annotations with mark lines. Data for mark lines is retrieved from the `data.annotations` object.
