# Grafana Events

:::info Version

Event bus is supported by the Apache ECharts visualization panel starting from version 4.2.0.

Apache ECharts version 4.6.0 allows unsubscribing from events to avoid memory leaks by returning extended result object.

:::

Grafana uses an event bus to publish application events to notify different parts of Grafana when the user acts. Apache ECharts can react to these actions by subscribing to one or more events.
