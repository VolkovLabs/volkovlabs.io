## Get started with examples

1. Open [echarts.volkovlabs.io](https://echarts.volkovlabs.io) with chart examples.
2. Locate the chart that looks similar to the one you want to build.
3. Open this chart in the edit mode (click on the three vertical dots located at the top-right corner and select the Edit menu).

   - On the right-hand side find the Code section, then Function parameter. 
   - Review and experiment with the code it contains. The chart dashboard is in the read-only mode so you cannot save your changes on our server.
   - Copy the ECharts function code (everything from the Function parameter).

4. Paste the copied code into the code editor of your Apache ECharts visualization panel.
5. You should see the rendered chart instantly.

   - You may need to refresh the chart to update its state.
