## Get started with examples

1. Open [echarts.volkovlabs.io](https://echarts.volkovlabs.io) with chart examples.
2. Locate the chart that looks similar to the one you want to build.
3. Open this chart in the edit mode.

   - Copy the function code from the code editor.
   - Start experimenting with its parameters. The chart dashboard is in the read-only mode so you cannot save your changes on our server.

4. Paste the code into the code editor of your Apache ECharts visualization panel.
5. You should see the rendered chart instantly.

   - You may need to refresh the chart to update its state.
