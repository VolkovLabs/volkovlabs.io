# Statistical and Data Mining

The `ecStat` is a separate library created to bring statistical and data mining abilities to the charting process in the Apache ECharts library.

:::info

The `ecStat` is supported by the Apache ECharts visualization panel starting from version 3.7.0.

:::

An example of using is on [echarts.volkovlabs.io](https://echarts.volkovlabs.io/d/U332C4K4z/scatter?orgId=1&editPanel=10). You can copy the code and use it as-is in your Grafana dashboard.
