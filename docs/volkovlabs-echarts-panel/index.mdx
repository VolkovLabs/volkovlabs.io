# Business Charts Panel

The Business Charts Panel plugin is a visualization extension for Grafana powered by the Apache ECharts library.

The Business Charts Panel allows you to integrate charts and graphs created by the [Apache ECharts library](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html) into your Grafana dashboard.
