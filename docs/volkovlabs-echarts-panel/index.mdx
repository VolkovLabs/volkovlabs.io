[Apache ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html) is a powerful and versatile data visualization library providing a wide range of chart types including statistical capabilities. It is written in pure JavaScript and based on [zrender](http://ecomfe.github.io/zrender/), a lightweight graphic library for chart rendering.

The Apache ECharts plugin offers an easy way of adding intuitive, interactive, and highly customizable charts into your Grafana dashboard.

To avoid any confusion, please consider the following:

- The Apache ECharts library is a chart generation library.
- The Apache ECharts Panel plugin integrates the Apache ECharts library into the Grafana dashboard for building charts and graphs of different types.
