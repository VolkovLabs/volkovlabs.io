# Base64 Image/PDF

You can use the Static data source to store any supported base64-encoded media files on your Grafana dashboard.

:::info Limitation

Static Data Source is an excellent solution for not huge sizes. If you get a `413 Request Entity Too Long` error, the Grafana limit is reached. In this case, consider using a database/storage data source. PostgreSQL is a good choice.

:::

## Fields

- String field `img` to store a base64 encoded media file with or without definition `data:image/IMAGE-FORMAT;base64,ENCODED-CONTENT`.
