# Node-RED

Node-RED is a good companion for Data Manipulation Plugin because it is simple, visual, and does not require developer experience.

Thanks to community member [Alejandro Guida](https://github.com/canob) for the explanation.

## Use Cases

Use cases of Node-RED related to Data Manipulation Plugin:

- Manage the authentication (get and renew the token) for API Services that require OAuth2 authentication. Doing “API inside API”, because Data Manipulation Plugin cannot manage that kind of authentication.
- API Gateway for “relax” CORS restrictions, because Node-RED default response includes `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` header.
- Manage authentication over all the destination databases and APIs to use single authentication for all the services.
