# Node-RED

Node-RED is a good companion for Data Manipulation Panel because it is simple, provides a visual interface, and does not require any developer experience.

Thanks to the community member [Alejandro Guida](https://github.com/canob) for the explanation.

## Use Cases

Node-RED usage scenarios involving the Data Manipulation Panel plugin:

- Manage authentication (acquire and renew tokens) for API Services using OAuth2 authentication. Because the Data Manipulation Plugin cannot handle this type of authentication, the API inside API approach is used.
- API Gateway to relax CORS restrictions, because Node-RED's default response includes the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` header.
- Manage authentication across all destination databases and APIs to preserve a single authentication type for all services.
