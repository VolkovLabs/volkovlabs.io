# Variables

Dashboard and Global variables will be replaced automatically in

- URL for Initial and Update requests.
- Header Parameters' values.
- Update the request's Payload.

To learn about three types of variables take a look at [Three types of Grafana's variables](/plugins/grafana/#dashboard-global-and-environment-variables).

## Global Variables

You can find [global built-in variables](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/variables/variable-types/global-variables/) in the Grafana documentation.
