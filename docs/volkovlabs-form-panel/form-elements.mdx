# Form Elements

## Layout

You have a choice of three layouts - Basic, Buttons Only, and Sections.
To switch between them open the Layout section.

/>

In the Basic layout, all form elements are positioned vertically, one following another.

With the Sections layout, you can create as many sections as needed and place sections either vertically or horizontally using the Orientation option.

As shown in the picture above, when the layout Section is chosen, the controls to create sections appear. For every section you can specify an ID, to use when referencing the section, and a name which will be a displayed section label.

The Buttons Only, as the name implies, keeps only buttons on your form. With that layout, all Panel Options related to other form elements are hidden, which gives a cleaner Edit mode to work with.

## Add a form element

Go to the Form Elements section to add a form element. You start by specifying ID, label, and type. After you click the 'Add Element' button, more element options are available to configure. Almost all element types have specific options. For instance, the Code Editor type in addition to the common option 'Width' also has 'Height'.

```js
const select = elements.find((element) => element.id === "select");

if (select) {
  return select.value === "max";
}
```
