## Layout

You have a choice of three layouts for the form elements - Basic, Buttons Only, and Sections.
To switch between them open the Layout section.

In the Basic layout, all form elements are positioned vertically, one following another.
With the Sections layout, you can create as many sections as needed and position sections either vertically or horizontally. Ensure to specify a section ID for every form element.

The Buttons Only, as the name implies, keeps only buttons on your form and all Panel Options related to all other form elements are hidden, so, you have a cleaner edit mode to work with.
