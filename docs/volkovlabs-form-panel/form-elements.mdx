# Form Elements

The Data Manipulation plugin is equipped with a rich variety of element types to cover almost any imaginable requirements of a web application.

## Layout

You have a choice of three layouts - Basic, Buttons Only, and Sections. To switch between them open the Layout section.

  width="80%"
/>

### Basic

In the Basic layout, all form elements are positioned vertically, one following another.

### Sections

With the Sections layout, you can create as many sections as needed and place sections either vertically or horizontally using the Orientation option.

As shown in the picture above, when the layout Section is chosen, the controls to create sections appear. For every section you can specify an ID, to use when referencing the section, and a name which will be a displayed section label.

### Buttons Only

The Buttons Only, as the name implies, keeps only buttons on your form. With that layout, all Panel Options related to other form elements are hidden, which gives a cleaner Edit mode to work with.

Element types have specific options. For instance, the Code Editor type in addition to the common option `Width` also has `Height`.

## Conditional Visibility

All form elements have the `Show if returned value is true` parameter. It is a code area where you can use JavaScript to create conditional statements.

For instance, the code below makes an element visible if in the other form element with the `id` equal to `select`, the user chose/typed value equal to `max`.

```js
const select = elements.find((element) => element.id === "select");

if (select) {
  return select.value === "max";
}
```
