# Form Elements

The Data Manipulation plugin is equipped with a rich variety of element types to cover almost any imaginable requirements of a web application.

## Layout

You have a choice of three layouts - Basic, Buttons Only, and Sections. To switch between them open the Layout section.

<Image

  width="80%"
/>

### Basic

In the Basic layout, all form elements are positioned vertically, one following another.

### Sections

With the Sections layout, you can create as many sections as needed and place sections either vertically or horizontally using the Orientation option.

As shown in the picture above, when the layout Section is chosen, the controls to create sections appear. For every section you can specify an ID, to use when referencing the section, and a name which will be a displayed section label.

### Buttons Only

The Buttons Only, as the name implies, keeps only buttons on your form. With that layout, all Panel Options related to other form elements are hidden, which gives a cleaner Edit mode to work with.

## Add a form element

Go to the Form Elements section to add a form element. Start by specifying ID, label, and type. After you click the Add Element button, more element options are available to configure.

Element types have specific options. For instance, the Code Editor type in addition to the common option `Width` also has `Height`.

#### Select Options from Query

## Conditional Visibility

Every form element has the <b>Show If returned value is true</b> parameter where you enter JavaScript code.

- If this code returns `true`, the element is shown on the panel.

Example code to check the current value of the `select` element and show the `dateTime` element if the value equal to `max`:

```js
const select = elements.find((element) => element.id === "select");

if (select) {
  return select.value === "max";
}
```
