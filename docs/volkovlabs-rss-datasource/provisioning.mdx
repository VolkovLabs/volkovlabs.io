# Provisioning

Grafana supports managing data sources by adding one or more YAML config files in the `provisioning/datasources` folder.

## Example

Example of provisioning the Business News Data Source.

```yaml
datasources:
  - name: Bitcoin
    type: volkovlabs-rss-datasource
    access: proxy
    orgId: 1
    uid: rZAdZdf7k
    version: 1
    editable: true
    jsonData:
      feed: https://news.bitcoin.com/feed/
```

## Data Sources

When provisioned, the Business News data source should be available in the data sources list.

  src="/img/plugins/volkovlabs-rss-datasource/datasource.png"
/>

### Feed URL

The URL must be contain all necessary characters ('/' at the end, etc.) to avoid redirects.

During testing you may see the error.

<Image
  title="Failed to fetch the provided URL."

/>

If the URL is correct and returns data, but returns an error. Try to add `/` to the end of the url to avoid redirect blocked by CORS policy.

As an example use `https://sitename/feed/` instead `https://sitename/feed`.

<Image
  title="Provided URL should be exactly as it returned from the RSS/Atom resource to avoid CORS policy restrictions."

/>

:::info Caching
If you already tried a data source with `https://sitename/feed` and added `/` still see an error. Please clear cache and use hard reload.
