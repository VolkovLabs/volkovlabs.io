# Deployment

:::info Signed as Private Plugin

Plugin is signed as a Private plugin using the default domain `http://localhost:3000`.

:::

If you are using a custom domain URL, there are various options depending on your deployment.

## NGINX Reverse proxy

We recommend using NGINX in front of the Grafana for an extra level of protection. It allows keeping the default domain and redirecting requests.

Here is an example of Docker Compose. You can find NGINX configuration files in the [repository](https://github.com/VolkovLabs/volkovlabs-env-datasource).

<Code
  url="https://github.com/VolkovLabs/volkovlabs-env-datasource/blob/main/docker-compose-nginx.yml"
  language="yaml"
/>

## Unsigned plugin

Take a look at [Allow Unsigned Plugins](/grafana/allow-unsigned/) section in the Grafana Crash Course.

## Build plugin and sign

:::info Requirements

Go 1.20 and Node.js version 18.

:::

You can build and sign the plugin manually following instructions.

```
yarn install
yarn build
yarn build:backend
grafana-toolkit plugin:sign --rootUrls http://CUSTOM-DOMAIN-URL/
```
